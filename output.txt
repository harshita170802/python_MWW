Sentence 1: SENTENCES AND THEIR PERPLEXITY 
 
 
1.
Sentence 2: it exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much
  the same criticisms.
Sentence 3:  8.728591527828165 
2.
Sentence 4: the treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex largely 
because the method is lax and the analysis seems  never to be pushed to 
a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point.
Sentence 5:  6.615961936568926 
3.
Sentence 6: there are more stems per item in athabascan which expresses the fact
  that the athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change 
in  diverging from proto-athabascan than the yokuts languages from 
proto-yokuts.
Sentence 7:  6.185036032343352 
4.
Sentence 8: this may be because the athabascan divergence began earlier;  or 
again because the athabascan languages spread over a very much
  larger territory; or both.
Sentence 9:  8.631973106403073 
5.
Sentence 10: the differentiation however is not very much greater as shown by the 
fact that athabascan shows 3.
Sentence 11:  6.538213540886913 
6.
Sentence 12: 46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.
Sentence 13:  9.060328853487057 
7.
Sentence 14: 75 for yokuts with a slightly greater number of languages represented
  in our sample: 24 as against 21.
Sentence 15:  5.502176915627405 
8.
Sentence 16: 46 the stemitem rate becomes 3.
Sentence 17:  9.670406878971576 
9.
Sentence 18: 75 in equivalent number  these general facts are mentioned to make 
clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to 
warrant  comparison.
Sentence 19: 5.179837570019059 
10.
Sentence 20: the greatest difference in the two sets of figures  is due to 
differences in the two sets of lists used.
Sentence 21:  10.332046148128628 
11.
Sentence 22: these differences in turn result from the fact that my yokuts 
vocabularies were  built up of terms selected mainly to insure 
unambiguity of english meaning  between illiterate informants and 
myself within a compact and uniform  territorial area but that 
hoijer's vocabulary is based on swadesh's  second glottochronological 
list which aims at eliminating  all items which might be culturally or 
geographically determined.
Sentence 23:  5.028892733101507 
12.
Sentence 24: swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was 
universal; i one that was specifically adapted to the san joaquin valley.
  6.844087594098681 
13.
Sentence 25: the  result is that i included 70 animal names but swadesh only 4;
  and somewhat similarly for plants 16 as against 4.
Sentence 26: 5.087179511422533 
14.
Sentence 27: swadesh and therefore  hoijer felt compelled to omit all terms 
denoting species or even  genera; their  classes of animal and plant 
terms are restricted to generalizations or  recurrent parts.
  6.046219493410928 
15.
Sentence 28: the groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as
  in size.
Sentence 29:  6.817408452020724 
16.
Sentence 30: other classes are included only by myself  or only by swadesh and 
hoijer.
Sentence 31:  7.978194376184139 
17.
Sentence 32: what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes:  body 
parts and products which with a proportionally nearly  even 
representation come out with nearly even ratios; 2.
Sentence 33: 6.12313065054314 
18.
Sentence 34: 7; nature  ratios 3.
Sentence 35:  13.148092146312546 
19.
Sentence 36: 1; ratios 3.
Sentence 37: 8.97651057505685 
20.
Sentence 38: 7; ratios 4.
Sentence 39: 13.148092146312546 
21.
Sentence 40: 4.
Sentence 41:  15.610129252044759 
22.
Sentence 42: it will be seen that where the scope is similar the athabascan ratios
  come out somewhat higher  except for verbs where alone the 
athabascan ratio is lower.
Sentence 43:  9.045337757272964 
23.
Sentence 44: this exception may be connected with hoijer's  use of a much higher 
percentage of verbs: 22% of his total  list as against 3.
  5.98896769908699 
Sentence 1: 24.
Sentence 2: or the exception may be due to a particular  durability peculiar to 
the athabascan verb.
Sentence 3:  8.61877755139381 
25.
Sentence 4: more word class ratios  determined in more languages will no doubt 
ultimately answer the question.
Sentence 5:  7.5205271291023905 
26.
Sentence 6: if word classes differ in their resistance or liability  to stem 
replacement within meaning slot it is conceivable that  individual 
meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually.
  7.786097295641408 
27.
Sentence 7: hoijer's athabascan and my yokuts share 71 identical meanings
  allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly big-large
  .
Sentence 8:  5.427950274147271 
28.
Sentence 9: for yokuts i tabulated these 71 items in five columns according as 
they were expressed  by 1 2 3 4 and more than 4 stems.
Sentence 10: 7.595570160058267 
29.
Sentence 11: the totals for these  five categories are not too uneven namely 20 
15 11 16 9 respectively.
Sentence 12:  6.524770666309441 
30.
Sentence 13: for athabascan with a greater range of stems the first two  of 
five corresponding columns were identical 1 and 2 stems; the three
  others had to be spread somewhat and are headed respectively f;
  f; and f stems.
Sentence 14:  6.550606834276504 
31.
Sentence 15: while the particular limits of these groupings  may  seem artificially 
arbitrary; they do fairly express a corresponding  grouping of more 
variable material and they eventuate also in five  classes along a 
similar scale containing approximately equal numbers  of cases namely 
19 14 15 11 12 in athabascan.
Sentence 16:  4.682836779562854 
32.
Sentence 17: when now  we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two 
language families appearing in the same column or grade or one column or 
grade apart or  two or three or four we find these differences: f   this 
distribution  can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades 
apart:  f; which divided by f gives a mean of 1.
Sentence 18:  6.434128523283288 
33.
Sentence 19: if  the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the 
two families  the distance would of course be 0.
Sentence 20:  6.513384599908015 
34.
Sentence 21: if it were wholly random and unrelated it would be 2.
  16.735658098076957 
35.
Sentence 22: 0 assuming the five classes were equal in  n which approximately 
they are.
Sentence 23:  5.825820622377272 
36.
Sentence 24: the actual mean of 1.
Sentence 25:  14.473707740438117 
37.
Sentence 26: 07 being  about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.
  6.210871206873012 
38.
Sentence 27: 0 of no correlation  it is evident that there is a pretty fair 
degree of similarity  in the behavior even of particular individual 
items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement.
Sentence 28: 7.955102452449978 
39.
Sentence 29: in 1960 david d  thomas published basic vocabulary in some mon-
khmer languages  which compares 8 mon-khmer languages  with the i- e 
language data on which swadesh based the revised  retention  rate and 
his revised 100 word  basic glottochronological list in towards greater 
accuracy h .
Sentence 30:  5.149571480829994 
40.
Sentence 31: thomas' findings are first that the individual items vary greatly and 
unpredictably in their persistence;  but second that the semantic 
groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence first 
conclusion on behavior of individual items is negative whereas  mine 
was partially positive.
Sentence 32:  5.624255452947053 
41.
Sentence 33: his second  conclusion on semantic word classes agrees with mine.
  7.591810951946381 
42.
Sentence 34: this second conclusion  independently arrived at by independent stud y 
of material from two  pairs of language families as different and remote 
from one another as these four are cannot be ignored.
Sentence 35:  6.799513485470034 
43.
Sentence 36: thomas also presents a  simple equation for deriving an index of 
persistence which weights not  only the number of stems per meaning 
but their relative  frequency.
Sentence 37: 5.4177742112174165 
Sentence 1: 44.
Sentence 2: thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is: 
stem identical in 8 languages 100%; stem frequencies  7 and 1 86%; stem 
frequencies 4 and 4 64%; stem frequencies  4 3 and 1 57%.
  6.06372728998952 
45.
Sentence 3: his formula will have to be weighed may be  altered or improved 
and it should be tested on additional bodies of  material.
  7.322069196929417 
46.
Sentence 4: but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning
  seems to be established as having significance in comparative 
situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance; and gleason
  presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area.
  7.723310418697585 
47.
Sentence 5: as to relative frequencies of competing roots  thomas with his 
'weighting' seems to be the first to have considered  the significance 
this might have.
Sentence 6: 8.547756579228864 
48.
Sentence 7: the problem needs further  exploration.
Sentence 8:  22.165869735070007 
49.
Sentence 9: i was at least conscious of the distinction in my full  yokuts 
presentation that awaits publication in which in listing 'two-stem
  meanings' i set off by asterisks those forms in which  n of stem b 
was f of stem a3 the unasterisked ones standing for f; or under 'four 
stems' i set off by asterisks  cases where the combined n of stems f 
was f.
Sentence 10:  4.8797042156450265 
50.
Sentence 11: these  findings and others which will in time be developed will 
affect  the method of glottochronological inquiry.
Sentence 12:  6.886249538313906 
51.
Sentence 13: if adjectival meanings show  relatively low retentiveness of stems 
as i am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world 
why should our basic  lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms 
but only 8 per cent  of animals and plants which replace much more 
slowly?  6.13463513531446 
52.
Sentence 14:  had hoijer  substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal 
and plant items  his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and 
the age of athabascan language separation smaller.
Sentence 15: 7.298545742196723 
53.
Sentence 16: and irrespective of the outcome  in centuries elapsed since 
splitting calculations obviously carry more  concordant and comparable 
meaning if they deal with the most stable  units than with variously 
unstable ones.
Sentence 17:  5.767439297566063 
54.
Sentence 18: it is evident that swadesh  has not only had much experience with 
basic vocabulary in many languages  but has acquired great tact and 
feeling for the expectable behavior  of lexical items.
  8.480552742907495 
55.
Sentence 19: why then this urge to include unstable items  in his basic list?
  7.68928528155087 
56.
Sentence 20:  it is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical  and 
cultural conditioning as possible.
Sentence 21:  12.442278316468771 
57.
Sentence 22: and why that insistence? 14.555411229397368 
58.
Sentence 23:   it is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal 
occurrence.
Sentence 24: 9.465001668613668 
59.
Sentence 25: but it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope  is a 
snare.
Sentence 26:  12.424296328749232 
60.
Sentence 27: not that such a list cannot be constructed; but the nearer  it 
comes to attaining universality the less significant will it be
  linguistically.
Sentence 28:  7.844105784047764 
61.
Sentence 29: its terms will tend to be labile or vague and they  will fit actual 
languages more and more badly.
Sentence 30:  6.42576203557217 
62.
Sentence 31: the practical operational  problem of lexicostatistics is the 
establishment of a basic  list of items of meaning against which the 
particular forms or terms  of languages can be matched as the medium of 
comparison.
Sentence 32: 7.290353792070676 
63.
Sentence 33: the most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as 
definable as  possible.
Sentence 34:  9.832938595357035 
Sentence 1: 64.
Sentence 2: in proportion as meanings are concrete we can better rely on their 
being insulated and distinctive.
Sentence 3:  8.437918402470649 
65.
Sentence 4: an elephant or a fox or a swan  or a cocopalm or a banana possess 
in unusually high degree this quality  of obvious common-sense 
indubitable identity as do an eye or tooth or nail.
Sentence 5:  4.78159956739805 
66.
Sentence 6: they isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously from the 
continuum of nature and existence; and they should be  given priority in 
the basic list as long as they continue to show these  qualities.
  7.5163949304143935 
67.
Sentence 7: with the universal list as his weapon swadesh  has  extended his 
march of conquest farther and farther into the past eight  ten twelve 
millennia back.
Sentence 8:  6.230423970274787 
68.
Sentence 9: and he has proclaimed greater or less  affiliation between all 
western hemisphere languages.
Sentence 10:  11.58297419486788 
69.
Sentence 11: some of this may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether 
by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence.
  6.794930051879173 
70.
Sentence 12: but the farther out he  moves the thinner will be his hold on 
conclusive evidence and the larger  the speculative component in his 
inferences.
Sentence 13: 7.749359232300311 
71.
Sentence 14: he has traversed provinces  and kingdoms but he has not 
consolidated them behind him nor  does he control them.
  7.8177381748128925 
72.
Sentence 15: he has announced results on hokan penutian  uto-aztecan and almost 
all other american families and phyla and has diagrammed their degree 
of interrelation; but he has not worked out by lexicostatistics one 
comprehensively complete classification of  even a single family other 
than salish.
Sentence 16:  6.98735958858241 
73.
Sentence 17: the  remote cloudy possible has values of its own- values of scope
  stimulus potential and imagination.
Sentence 18:  5.542917982132687 
74.
Sentence 19: but there is also a firm aspect  to lexicostatistics: the aspect 
of learning the internal organization  of obvious natural genetic groups 
of languages as well as their more  remote and elusive external 
links; of classification first with elapsed  age merely a by-product; of 
acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in athabascan in yokuts 
in uto-aztecan in the last  few thousand years as well as forecasting 
what more anciently may have happened between them.
Sentence 20: 6.996827000608089 
75.
Sentence 21: this involves step-by-step progress and such  will have to be the 
day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing  body of scientific 
inquiry.
Sentence 22:  6.66389881289832 
76.
Sentence 23: if of the founders of glottochronology  swadesh has escaped our 
steady plodding and lees has repudiated his  own share in the founding 
that is no reason why we should swerve.
Sentence 24: 8.503651134789727 
77.
Sentence 25: there is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by swadesh's
  rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown
  so vast.
Sentence 26:  7.69902962183697 
78.
Sentence 27: it seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for 
lexicostatistic studies on a more humble solid and limited basis.
  9.248917704121226 
79.
Sentence 28: i would propose first an abandonment of attempts at a  universal 
lexical list as intrinsically unachievable and operationally  inadequate 
in proportion as it is achieved.
Sentence 29:  7.014494436854544 
80.
Sentence 30: i would propose  next as the prime requirement for constitution of 
new basic lists  items whose forms show as high an empirical retention 
rate as possible.
Sentence 31:  7.607930874954649 
81.
Sentence 32: there would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme
  of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable.
  8.693824794246563 
Sentence 1: 82.
Sentence 2: an attempted middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word 
alphabetized dictionary  from which every fiftieth word was selected.
  7.03398687827998 
83.
Sentence 3: doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise 
about the methods for applying these policies.
Sentence 4:  5.708822330446606 
84.
Sentence 5: it was nevertheless  almost incredible that four years after yalta 
there should be a  complete split over germany with hot heads on both 
sides planning to  use the germans against their former allies and 
with nazi-minded germans  expecting to recover their power by fighting 
on one side or the  other.
Sentence 6:  7.473001118686811 
85.
Sentence 7: when the yalta conference  opened the american policy of 
postponing all discussion of russia's  western boundaries until the 
peace conference had broken down.
Sentence 8: 6.126432428280739 
86.
Sentence 9: starting  in great force late in december from a line stretching 
from  east prussia to budapest the red armies had swept two hundred miles
  across poland to the oder thirty miles from berlin and the upper
  danube region was being rapidly overrun while the western allies
  had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the rhine.
  5.657925738234017 
87.
Sentence 10: the long  delay in opening the second front was now working to 
russia's advantage.
Sentence 11:  6.916450125045957 
88.
Sentence 12: the west was now glad to propose the 1919 curzon line  which was 
substantially russia's 1941 border as the boundary between  russia and 
poland.
Sentence 13:  7.762277199031083 
89.
Sentence 14: when this proposal was made stalin spoke with stronger emotion than 
at any other time during the conference.
Sentence 15:  8.106352765305958 
90.
Sentence 16: he stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject.
  10.302529178852147 
91.
Sentence 17: the bitter  memory of russia's exclusion from the paris peace 
conference and of the west's effort to stamp out bolshevism at its birth 
boiled  up within him.
Sentence 18:  5.377873882341562 
92.
Sentence 19: you would drive us into shame he declared.
Sentence 20:  13.406219579674467 
93.
Sentence 21: the white russians and the ukrainians would say that stalin and 
molotov  were far less reliable defenders of russia than curzon and 
clemenceau.
Sentence 22: 6.075272924218582 
94.
Sentence 23: yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accepted  the curzon 
line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be  digressions from 
that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of poland in some regions.
  7.306409119000506 
95.
Sentence 24: he did not mind the line itself which churchill  declared in the 
house of commons on february 27 1945 he had  always believed to be just 
and right but he did not want it called by a hated name.
  7.4257187932759035 
96.
Sentence 25: the west had long since forgotten the events  of 1919 but it was not 
so easy for the red leaders who felt that they  had suffered great 
injustice in that period.
Sentence 26:  8.618551205849084 
97.
Sentence 27: in the dunn-atherton  memorandum of february 4 1942 the state 
department had expected  to be able to hold russia in check by 
withholding agreement to  her 1941 boundaries.
Sentence 28:  6.832600518618727 
98.
Sentence 29: now stalin made it clear that he meant to move poland's western 
borders deep into germany back to the western  neisse-oder river 
lines taking not only east prussia and all of  silesia but pomerania 
and the tip of brandenburg back to and including  stettin.
  6.832171002716006 
99.
Sentence 30: from six to nine million additional germans would be evicted though 
most would have fled and poland would receive far more  from germany than 
the poor territories including the great pripet  marshes which she lost 
to russia.
Sentence 31: 4.827482875085593 
Sentence 1: 100.
Sentence 2: stalin declared that he preferred to continue the war a little 
longer although it costs us blood in order to give poland compensation in 
the west at the expense  of the germans.
Sentence 3:  6.819269873304742 
101.
Sentence 4: by this time churchill was not so cordial toward  moving poland 
westward as he had been at teheran where he and  eden had both heartily 
approved the idea.
Sentence 5:  6.969062989540919 
102.
Sentence 6: after a prolonged study of the oder line on a map at teheran 
churchill liked the  picture.
Sentence 7:  8.74814951941821 
103.
Sentence 8: he would tell the poles he said that they had been given a fine 
place to live in more than three hundred miles each way.
Sentence 9: 9.564420203776912 
104.
Sentence 10: at yalta he thought more about the six million germans who would
  have to leave trying to find work in germany and roosevelt objected
  to the western neisse river being chosen in the south instead  of 
the eastern neisse both of which flow into the oder.
Sentence 11:  6.906432085468935 
105.
Sentence 12: the  issue was left in abeyance presumably for the peace 
conference.
Sentence 13: 6.210871206873012 
106.
Sentence 14: however  there was no real question of the justice of creating a 
strong  poland both industrially and agriculturally and one unplagued 
by large  minorities of germans or russians.
Sentence 15:  7.364264802002414 
107.
Sentence 16: the moving of millions of the  german master-race from the very 
heart of junkerdom to make room  for the polish slavs whom they had 
enslaved and openly planned to exterminate  was a drastic operation but 
there was little doubt that it  was historically justified.
  5.895075327715992 
108.
Sentence 17: of more importance to  the west than poland's boundaries was the 
character of her government.
Sentence 18: 9.827207519900966

144.

145.
Sentence 13: the same editorial continued that we expected to democrati ze  japan

position to deal with the localized aberrations of the soviet union.

260.

Sentence 16: 30.214403434210066

264.

Sentence 27:  10.293697780295807 
269.
Sentence 28: for  a number of years kentucky louisiana and several other states 
have  been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that 
serve nearby school districts in several counties.
Sentence 29: 5.563219782861777 
270.
Sentence 30: these schools are intended  to provide the facilities and

  6.254431446250755 
273.
Sentence 34: the title 8 program of the national  defense education act of 
1958 was a great spur to this trend toward  area schools.
  7.563651808746753 
274.
Sentence 35: by 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states.
  10.065628120255884 
275.
Sentence 36: they were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor
  surplus and in 10 of the minor areas.
Sentence 37: 0.0 
276.
Sentence 38: an extension of this program into relation to new  some of this 
trend toward area vocational schools has been  related to the 
problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their  desire to attract 
new industry.
Sentence 39:  7.288072978192694 
Sentence 1: 277.
Sentence 2: the major training need of a new  industrial plant is a short 
period of pre-employment training for a large number of semi-skilled 
machine operators.
Sentence 3:  6.230206927876231 
278.
Sentence 4: a few key skilled workers  experienced in the company's type of

a similar plant elsewhere.
Sentence 5:  7.260278226014195 
279.
Sentence 6: a prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run
  advantages of training programs in the area to supply future 
skilled workers  and provide supplementary extension courses for its 
employees.
Sentence 7: 6.00098756648431 
280.
Sentence 8: the existence of a public school vocational training program in
  trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be 
filled.
Sentence 9:  7.25963014279634 
281.
Sentence 10: additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative 
programs  worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities staff
  and program are in being.
Sentence 11:  4.958578086944874 
282.
Sentence 12: thus besides the training provided to youth  in school the 
existence of the school program can have supplementary  benefits to 
industry which make it an asset to industrial development  efforts.
  7.3763097529501325 
283.
Sentence 13: few states make effective use of their existing vocational
  education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new
  industry.
Sentence 14:  6.847167845290544 
284.
Sentence 15: the opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their
  vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis
  to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that my be 
quickly  local focus the major weakness of vocational training programs 
in  labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job 
demands.
Sentence 16:  5.668668216581743 
285.
Sentence 17: this weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas for it is 
inherent  in the system of local school districts in this country.
  6.30692726820347 
286.
Sentence 18: planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to
  local employer needs for trained workers.
Sentence 19:  6.886249538313906 
287.
Sentence 20: all the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the 
importance of first making a local  survey of skill needs of 
estimating the growth of local jobs  and of consulting with local 
employers on the types of courses and  their content.
Sentence 21:  5.436987076064887 
288.
Sentence 22: furthermore there is a cautious conservatism  on the part of those 
making local skill surveys.
Sentence 23: 10.804211971164948 
289.
Sentence 24: local jobs can be seen and counted while opportunities elsewhere are 
regarded as more hypothetical.
Sentence 25:  5.863668339877186 
290.
Sentence 26: while the u s department of labor has a program of projecting 
industry and occupational employment trends and  publishing current 
outlook statements there is little tangible evidence  that these 
projections have been used extensively in local curriculum  planning.
  9.282266892317814 
291.
Sentence 27: the u s office of education continues to stress  local surveys 
rather than national surveys.
Sentence 28:  9.744313100969636 
292.
Sentence 29: this procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus 
areas with a long history  of declining employment.
Sentence 30:  8.406814643643322 
293.
Sentence 31: elaborate studies have been made in labor  surplus areas in order 
to identify sufficient numbers of local job  vacancies and future 
replacement needs for certain skills to justify  training programs for 
those skills.
Sentence 32:  5.622877135680528 
294.
Sentence 33: no effort is made in the same studies  to present information on 
regional or national demand trends in these  skills or to consider 
whether regional or national demands for other  skills might provide 
much better opportunities for the youth to be  trained.
  7.09195751232876 
Sentence 1: 295.
Sentence 2: moreover the current information on what types of training  are 
needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary.
Sentence 3:  6.385929246976759 
296.
Sentence 4: there simply is not enough material available on the types of job 
skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are 
required  or most suitable.
Sentence 5:  6.69198329848934 
297.
Sentence 6: much of the available information comes not from the  federal 
government but from an exchange of experiences among states.
  7.691756325801561 
298.
Sentence 7: state and local agencies in the vocational education  field must 
be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities.
  8.431595530622063 
299.
Sentence 8: there is a need for an expanded federal effort to provide
  research and information to help guide state education departments 
and  local school boards in existing programs.
Sentence 9:  7.130769618740224 
300.
Sentence 10: a related question  is whether unemployed workers can be 
motivated to take the training provided.
Sentence 11:  8.67520113331406 
301.
Sentence 12: there is little evidence that existing public or private training
  programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in
  their programs even though they must pay tuition receive no 
subsistence payments and are not guaranteed a job.
Sentence 13: 6.4594915644075535 
302.
Sentence 14: however there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the 
time and effort to acquire  training.
Sentence 15:  10.920109084842016 
303.
Sentence 16: again one major difficulty is the local focus.
Sentence 17:  7.976437652631501 
304.
Sentence 18: a  training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees 
unless there  is some apparent prospect for better employment 
opportunities afterwards  and the prospect may be poor if the training 
is aimed solely  at jobs in the local community.
Sentence 19:  6.019102548364887 
305.
Sentence 20: if there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled 
jobs elsewhere many more workers can be expected to respond.
  9.105654181468427 
306.
Sentence 21: another problem is who will pay for the training.
  10.394523248337816 
307.
Sentence 22: local school districts are hard pressed financially and 
unenthusiastic  about vocational training.
Sentence 23:  6.421632332635154 
308.
Sentence 24: programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available 
or local business leaders demand it.
Sentence 25:  7.032105024464237 
309.
Sentence 26: even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local 
support  for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests 
it.
Sentence 27:  5.797532452103437 
310.
Sentence 28: state governments have been taking the lead in establishing area 
vocational schools but their focus is still on area job opportunities.
  7.6506071880084425 
311.
Sentence 29: only  the federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run 
and  nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled 
manpower  needs.
Sentence 30:  7.792996899626661 
312.
Sentence 31: if only state funds were used to pay for the vocational  education 
it could be argued that the state should not have to  bear the cost of 
vocational training which would benefit employers in  other states.
  10.367933526462098 
313.
Sentence 32: however if federal funds are used it would be entirely  appropriate 
to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere  as well as 
for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment.
Sentence 33:  6.48539357835391 
314.
Sentence 34: such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave 
the area and find  jobs in other localities.
Sentence 35:  9.205662875528139 
315.
Sentence 36: a further possibility is suggested by the example of the g i bills 
and also by some recent trends  in attitudes toward improving college 
education: that is to provide  financial assistance to individuals for 
vocational training when local  facilities are inadequate.
  5.460036246397947 
Sentence 1: 316.
Sentence 2: this probably would require some support  for subsistence as 
well as for tuition but the total would be no  greater than for the 
proposals of unemployment compensation or a youth  conservation corps.
  7.675429495858721 
317.
Sentence 3: a maximum of $600 per year per student would  enable many to take 
training away from home.
Sentence 4:  6.923526321492968 
318.
Sentence 5: a program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on 
the national interest in training highly skilled labor.
Sentence 6: 9.91907292171144 
319.
Sentence 7: instead of being limited to the poor  training facilities in 
remote areas the student would be able to  move to large institutions 
of concentrated specialized training.
Sentence 8:  6.191809541506003 
320.
Sentence 9: such  specialized training institutions could be located near the 
most rapidly  growing industries where the equipment and job 
experience exist and  where the future employment opportunities are 
located.
Sentence 10:  6.823307612024259 
321.
Sentence 11: this would heighten  possibilities for part-time cooperative on-
the-job and extension training.
Sentence 12:  9.774596814044259 
322.
Sentence 13: personal financial assistance would enable more  emphasis to be 
placed on the interests of the individual.
Sentence 14:  10.587179626961042 
323.
Sentence 15: his aptitudes  and preferences could be given more weight in 
selecting the proper  training.
Sentence 16:  6.352670641660905 
324.
Sentence 17: but briefly the topping configuration must be examined for its
  inferences.
Sentence 18: 10.422895192819478 
325.
Sentence 19: then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had
  further forecasting significance.
Sentence 20: 9.429982292559522 
326.
Sentence 21: and then the application of the  count rules to the width of the 
configuration give us an  intial estimate of the probable depth of the 
decline.
Sentence 22:  8.749681059546296 
327.
Sentence 23: the very idea  of their being count rules implies that there is 
some sort of proportion  to be expected between the amount of 
congestive activity and  the extent of the breakaway movement.
  7.346821920906662 
328.
Sentence 24: this expectation is what really sold point and figure.
  10.867675364171879 
329.
Sentence 25: but there is no positive  and consistently demonstrable 
relationship in the strictest sense.
Sentence 26:  13.741100841700375 
330.
Sentence 27: experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply and
  in fine these merely dwell upon a relationship between th e 
durations  and intensities of events.
Sentence 28:  7.1988137228760145 
331.
Sentence 29: after all too much does not happen too  suddenly nor does very 
little take long.
Sentence 30:  7.321889212829819 
332.
Sentence 31: the advantages and disadvantages  of these two types of charting 
bar charting and point and  figure charting remain the subject of fairly 
good natured litigation  among their respective professional advocates 
with both methods enjoying  in common one irrevocable merit.
  6.340239890013639 
333.
Sentence 32: they are both trend-following  methods.
Sentence 33:  16.67249252416214 
334.
Sentence 34: even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum the 
odds still favor them both for the trend in effect is  always  more 
likely to continue than to reverse.
Sentence 35:  7.296276724163929 
335.
Sentence 36: of course many  more things are charted besides prices.
  10.983520213806544 
336.
Sentence 37: the foregoing have been methods  of charting prices but now let us 
look at some of the other indices that are customarily charted and which 
are looked to for their forecasting  abilities.
Sentence 38: 8.207265050410127 
337.
Sentence 39: the search for forecasting  formulae is ceaseless.
  11.647719625067843 
338.
Sentence 40: correlations have been worked up between  the loading of freight 
cars and the course of stock price.
Sentence 41:  7.573088559200683 
Sentence 1: 339.
Sentence 2: the theory  behind this is of course fundamentalist in character.
  9.11334529037023 
340.
Sentence 3: as the number  of reported freight car loadings increased this 
was taken to indicate increased industrial activity and consequently 
increased stock earnings  implying fatter dividends and implying 
therefore increased stock  market prices.
Sentence 4:  7.5604248182385145 
341.
Sentence 5: we now know that things rarely ever work out in such  cut-and-
dried fashion and that car loadings while perhaps interesting enough are 
nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock 
prices turn.
Sentence 6:  5.268257814628907 
342.
Sentence 7: but the quest for such an index  goes on ceaselessly with all 
manner of investors and speculators participating  ranging from the 
sedate institutional type virtually to the  proverbial shoe-string 
operator all seeking doggedly studiously daily-  and often nightly- for 
the enchanting index that will foretell the eternal secret: which way 
will the market move; up or down? 6.208221292396618 
343.
Sentence 8:  it recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of 
youth a quest heavily invested in during the days of wooden ships.
  5.525835323295882 
344.
Sentence 9: just  as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern 
men who  carry on the quest for the enchanting index.
Sentence 10: 6.765292791664436 
345.
Sentence 11: much of this goes on in offices high up in wall street's lofty wind-
swept towers.
Sentence 12:  8.799700606863594 
346.
Sentence 13: there sit men who make moving averages of  weekly volume monthly 
averages of price-earnings ratios ratios of  the number of advances to 
the number of declines ratios of an individual  stock's performance to 
overall market performance ratios of rising  price volume to falling 
price volume odd-lot indices and what not.
Sentence 14:  6.5329568239833335 
347.
Sentence 15: they are concerned with all things traded in securities bonds cocao
  coffee soybeans cotton tin oats etc.
Sentence 16:  7.130610841418014 
348.
Sentence 17: and along  chicago's  west jackson boulevard la salle street and 
around the merchandise mart plaza there sit men who chart crop reports 
who divide the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported 
green-bugs and the number of hogs by the amount of corn.
  7.039949895619303 
349.
Sentence 18: they plot the open  interest curves rainfall curves and they even 
divide democratic  congressmen by republican congressmen.
  6.376876511860498 
350.
Sentence 19: all these things and countless  more enter into their 
calculations and yet the enchanting index remains  non-forthcoming.
  9.672559394096337 
351.
Sentence 20: not at any rate in the fuller sense of the word.
Sentence 21:  10.41961614256415 
352.
Sentence 22: the markets are far too subtle and the last word in these
  endeavors will doubtless never be written for the enchanting index
  is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth.
Sentence 23:  6.7869342764888 
353.
Sentence 24: but whereas civilized  men no longer pursue the fountain they never 
abandoned their pursuit  of the enchanting index.
Sentence 25:  6.478669021782826 
354.
Sentence 26: we mentioned odd-lot indices a  few paragraphs ago.
  12.350455461918722 
355.
Sentence 27: in the stock market the normal trading package  is a hundred 
shares just as 5000 bushels is the standard grain contract  package.
  7.363529915575263 
356.
Sentence 28: a stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed via a 
special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange.
  10.899283628510071 
357.
Sentence 29: this  results in a separate record being made distinguishing these 
trades  from the overall volume of trading.
Sentence 30:  5.427950274147271 
358.
Sentence 31: according to the theory underlying odd-lot indices the trader who 
trades odd lots is most likely  a small trader one who can't afford to 
trade round lots.
Sentence 32:  7.525890903229159 
Sentence 1: 359.
Sentence 2: or to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast 
they represent  a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of 
traders.
Sentence 3:  5.747675891275695 
360.
Sentence 4: falling  most easily prey to an adverse market movement for this 
rank of traders  can least afford to lose virtually anything the odd-lot 
traders  do marketwise is taken to exemplify the wrong thing to do.
  5.841774192096529 
361.
Sentence 5: figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales
  are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers.
  6.04791021375758 
362.
Sentence 6: odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to 
their particular statistical recipe.
Sentence 7:  7.315499381373 
363.
Sentence 8: they might for example plot it exactly  as is or they might make ten 
day moving averages of it or longer  moving averages or they might 
simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases  to odd-lot sales.
  5.151054311774119 
364.
Sentence 9: the particular recipe is a matter of individual  taste.
  14.083858705166973 
365.
Sentence 10: the data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price  chart 
usually of a popular stock average.
Sentence 11:  6.5934285901583936 
366.
Sentence 12: towards the end of  an intermediate or major rise while the top 
is forming on the price  chart it is frequently observed that the odd-
lot buying increases sharply.
Sentence 13:  5.996607848305864 
367.
Sentence 14: this warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite
  likely to be a top.
Sentence 15:  6.881506374313357 
368.
Sentence 16: similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle  towards the end 
of an intermediate or major decline usually while  the bottom is being 
formed on the price chart it is characteristic  that an increase is 
noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist  that a bottom is 
becoming a greater likelihood.
Sentence 17:  6.539445720418356 
369.
Sentence 18: thus in the aggregate  the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the 
tops and sells at the bottoms notwithstanding occasional individual 
exceptions.
Sentence 19: 6.675713120289759 
370.
Sentence 20: while it had long been known in general that the public is always 
wrong the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical
  basis.
Sentence 21:  6.884772243478044 
371.
Sentence 22: one might well wonder why the public is always wrong  and the 
question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken 
and the egg.
Sentence 23:  6.666574571708565 
372.
Sentence 24: which came first? 16.656679898684356 
373.
Sentence 25:  is it really that  the public buys at the tops and not that the 
market tops out when  the public buys? 7.238285181774791 
374.
Sentence 26:  and the converse at bottoms.
Sentence 27:  18.014471815902706 
375.
Sentence 28: does the public  usually sell at bottoms or does the market usually 
bottom  out when the public sells?  7.466065862594832 
376.
Sentence 29:    we have been using the word  public in quotation marks that is 
in its vernacular connotation  with reference to the odd-lot index 
theory.
Sentence 30:  10.599296140579101 
377.
Sentence 31: obviously someone has  to sell in order for someone to buy and vice 
versa.
Sentence 32:  6.456554449617568 
378.
Sentence 33: and while all concerned are members of the literal public somewhat 
less than all concerned  although still a majority form the quotation 
marked public.
Sentence 34:  8.221542909854108 
379.
Sentence 35: and the public minus the public leaves the so-called sophisticated
  element- the element on the other end of the public's
  transactions.
Sentence 36:  8.880868923355205 
380.
Sentence 37: this element is often called strong  hands.
Sentence 38:  12.83916464908928 
381.
Sentence 39: strong hands differ from weak hands in that their operations  are 
the primary movers.
Sentence 40:  5.739601853441883 
Sentence 1: 382.
Sentence 2: they initiate campaigns so to speak  even if this initiation is 
diffused among them and their concerted action  only psychologically 
organized.
Sentence 3: 7.832937789961806 
383.
Sentence 4: strong hands act; weak hands react.
Sentence 5:  8.43480713758077 
384.
Sentence 6: strong hands move first; weak hands ask what is going on?
  8.419867058553036 
385.
Sentence 7:  when strong hands buy they are able to buy more and they do it even
  in the face of bearish news reports.
Sentence 8:  6.309614669264672 
386.
Sentence 9: they are able to sit more patiently  with what they have bought.
  15.915680586605463 
387.
Sentence 10: needless to say strong hands are  not eager to be joined by weak 
hands for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what 
these weak hands unload on the way up  at higher prices during the run-
up phase of the campaign.
Sentence 11:  5.445008461773956 
388.
Sentence 12: certain  badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel 
that there is something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal 
about this interplay of competitive forces.
Sentence 13:  6.54618033837685 
389.
Sentence 14: but after all can anyone imagine  a market wherein the reverse of 
these things were true?  7.87671515556022 
390.
Sentence 15:  try to  imagine a market in which only a minority of traders 
would lose and  the majority would make consistent profits.
  7.060411495153203 
391.
Sentence 16: how much and how many profits  could a majority take out of the 
losses of a few? 8.22178944124042 
392.
Sentence 17:    moreover the taunt concerning the sophisticated echelon and its 
alleged  erudition is put to test during every campaign and accrues 
only  upon results; not before.
Sentence 18:  6.221143152558621 
393.
Sentence 19: it quite often happens that campaigns go  askew resulting in a 
most unflattering deterioration of strong hands  into played-out hands 
just as a member of a former campaign's public  may emerge 
flatteringly right the next time.
Sentence 20: 6.194083601421998 
394.
Sentence 21: membership  in the echelons fluctuates too.
Sentence 22:  10.472119682746735 
395.
Sentence 23: the study of odd-lot indices is somehow akin to the spectacle of a 
man trying to outfox his own shadow  what with all observers trying to 
get on the side of the few  at the same time.
Sentence 24:  9.078367714240208 
396.
Sentence 25: the usefulness of this study and of configuration  analysis as well 
declines in direct proportion to the dissemination of its use.
  8.133535426154651 
397.
Sentence 26: it has to by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word 
few.
Sentence 27:  13.770067478850558 
398.
Sentence 28: diametric opposition must persist as to the future course of prices 
if there is to persist a market at all.
Sentence 29: 8.438543613793158 
399.
Sentence 30: and  the few must win what the many lose for the opposite 
arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all and is in 
fact unimaginable.
Sentence 31:  6.459068959620058 
400.
Sentence 32: there need be no squeamishness about admitting this.
  13.901817684052416 
401.
Sentence 33: anyone still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is 
invited  to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently 
wins what  the minority loses.
Sentence 34:  6.724189709273033 
402.
Sentence 35: mr john magee whose work has been discussed  in this chapter was 
quoted in a new yorker magazine profile as saying- h of course you have 
to remember it's a good thing  for us chartists that there aren't more 
of us.
Sentence 36:  6.557999302866857 
403.
Sentence 37: if you got too  many people investing by this method their 
operations would begin to  affect stock prices and thus throw the charts 
off.
Sentence 38:  6.525936975929947 
404.
Sentence 39: the method would become self-defeating.
Sentence 40: 17.638591467701175 
405.
Sentence 41: mr alexander h wheelan's  study helps in point and figure 
technique tells the readers- we  assure you that the total number of 
Sentence 1: people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of 
the sum total of those operating  in the securities and commodities 
markets.
Sentence 2:  5.331899125577266 
406.
Sentence 3: what with  traders trading for so many different objectives and 
what with there  being so many unique and individualized market theories 
and trading techniques in use and more coming into use all the time it is 
hard to  imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire 
enough  fans to invalidate itself.
Sentence 4:  6.987452068829289 
407.
Sentence 5: nevertheless all theories and techniques  lead but to one of two 
possible modes of expression if they lead  to a market committment at 
all.
Sentence 6:  6.851743272883243 
408.
Sentence 7: in the final analysis then the user  becomes either a bull or a 
bear in a given instance notwithstanding  any amount of forethought 
and calculation however elaborate.
Sentence 8:  8.421820595988144 
409.
Sentence 9: thus  while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed it is 
commonplace for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-
subscribed.
Sentence 10: 5.369386226541101 
410.
Sentence 11: though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse the
  possible conclusions remain but two.
Sentence 12:  9.507926812550991 
411.
Sentence 13: the purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to 
introduce the reader to a general background knowledge  of the various 
types and capabilities of the forecasting methods alrea dy  in use so 
that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself  the 
validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that is to 
follow and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests
  for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead.
  5.43952840341129 
412.
Sentence 14: in assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961 the  question as 
always is the prospect for general business activity.
Sentence 15:  8.24710587069603 
413.
Sentence 16: by  and large what happens to business as a whole will govern the 
relationship  between demand and supply conditions in the capital 
markets and will thus determine interest rates.
Sentence 17:  5.244379598405574 
414.
Sentence 18: moreover the trend of general business  activity in 1961 will exert 
a decisive influence on fiscal monetary and other federal policies which 
affect interest rates.
Sentence 19: 7.531462277246944 
415.
Sentence 20: nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general 
business  activity.
Sentence 21:  6.6694398589597395 
416.
Sentence 22: during much of the year the general level of business  activity 
has moved along on a record-high plateau but there have been  persistent 
signs of slack in the economy.
Sentence 23:  8.725150371275522 
417.
Sentence 24: the tendency for general  business activity to soften somewhat is 
becoming more evident.
Sentence 25: 7.451621278813451 
418.
Sentence 26: although the pause in the advance of general business activity this 
year  has thus far been quite modest it is hard to escape the conclusion
  that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 
1961  and possibly somewhat longer.
Sentence 27:  7.821415672237971 
419.
Sentence 28: it is difficult to see any powerful  sources of strength on the 
horizon at this time which would give the  economy a new upward thrust.
  8.75020937187674 
420.
Sentence 29: the rate of plant and equipment spending  by business and 
industry now seems to be topping out and facing some  decline.
  9.573802181444474 
421.
Sentence 30: in earlier business cycles when this occurred the country usually
  experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage
  financing became easier to obtain.
Sentence 31:  6.000282688333569 
422.
Sentence 32: at this time however there are  signs that increased availability 
of mortgage credit will not act with  the usual speed to stimulate a 
sharp rise in residential construction.
Sentence 33: 8.270766653029934 
Sentence 1: 423.
Sentence 2: these signs are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of
  the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments
  .
Sentence 3:  6.244699261799836 
424.
Sentence 4: on the other hand in a more favorable vein general business activity 
should receive some stimulus from rising federal  spending and the 
reduction in business inventories has probably  run a good part of its 
course.
Sentence 5: 8.458842730812647 
425.
Sentence 6: the 2% increase in retail sales in october  to a 4-month high is 
encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer 
survey by the national industrial conference board which shows a decided 
pickup in consumer spending plans.
Sentence 7:  5.434321296452985 
426.
Sentence 8: the pattern of general business activity which probably lies  ahead 
of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961
  before a new rise in economic activity gets under way.
  7.496129545834734 
427.
Sentence 9: the recovery  will probably be sparked by a rising rate of 
housing starts next spring  in response to more readily available 
mortgage credit as well as by  an expansion of government spending 
well sustained consumer spending  and some rebuilding of business 
inventories.
Sentence 10:  4.975946076298156 
428.
Sentence 11: what does the general business outlook suggest about the trend  of 
long-term rates in 1961?  9.757317843788147 
429.
Sentence 12:  it suggests that during the next several  months through the 
spring of 1961 the demand for long-term capital  funds may be 
moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to  move a little 
lower especially the rates on federal state and local  bonds as well as 
those on publicly offered corporate bonds.
Sentence 13:  5.408762142994459 
430.
Sentence 14: however  as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at 
present as well  as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved 
by voters the  over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain 
high so that  any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand 
should not be great.
Sentence 15:  5.7067947172278215 
431.
Sentence 16: it seems likely  moreover that with an increase in the rate of
  saving in mortgage lending institutions interest rates on 
residential mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next 
year although  the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may 
occur primarily  in other terms than interest rate eg easier downpayment
  and amortization terms.
Sentence 17:  5.580339947440587 
432.
Sentence 18: if the trend of general business activity  follows the pattern 
suggested here we are likely to see additional  steps by the federal 
reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit.
Sentence 19: 8.502918719811868 
433.
Sentence 20: certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong 
possibility as well as an easier reserve position for the  banking 
system.
Sentence 21:  6.092132771284809 
434.
Sentence 22: however the monetary authorities will continue to  be required to 
pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our 
international balance of payments position and the outflow  of gold as 
well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive  liquidity 
in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of  monetary policy 
measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle.
  7.485287906641234 
435.
Sentence 23: one of the most intriguing questions is whether the recent 
departures of the federal reserve authorities from confining their open 
market operations to treasury bills will spread  into longer-term 
government securities in the next few months.
Sentence 24:  7.402659368120394 
436.
Sentence 25: to  the extent that the new administration has its wishes the 
federal  reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout 
the entire maturity range of government securities and aggressively seek 
to force  down long-term interest rates.
Sentence 26:  6.452321895656389 
Sentence 1: 437.
Sentence 2: the principle of bills only  or bills preferably seems so strongly 
accepted by the federal  reserve that it is difficult to envision 
conditions which would persuade  the authorities to depart radically 
from it by extending their open  market purchases regularly into long-
term government securities.
Sentence 3: 5.792661700918284 
438.
Sentence 4: however to the extent that the monetary authorities in their effort
  to ease credit in the next several months conduct their open market
  operations in longer-term government bonds they will certainly act 
to  accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a 
result  of market forces.
Sentence 5:  6.381625829586266 
439.
Sentence 6: by the end of the spring of 1961 assuming  that a general 
business recovery gets under way interest rates should  begin to edge 
upward again depending upon the vigor of the recovery  and the 
determination with which the monetary authorities move to  restrain 
credit availability.
Sentence 7:  6.34045141029453 
440.
Sentence 8: my guess would be that interest rates will  decline moderately 
into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn 
up gradually to recover the ground lost during  the downturn.
  6.930971193989854

Sentence 9: it is pertinent to ask the question: has the  long upswing of 
interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course and are 
we now entering a period in which both capital  market forces and 
federal policies will produce a prolonged decline  of interest rates?
  5.477701607027739 
442.
Sentence 10:  my answer is in the negative because i believe  that total 
capital demands during the sixties will continue to press  against 
available supplies and interest rates will generally tend to  be firm at 
high levels.
Sentence 11:  6.7256118001885685 
443.
Sentence 12: this view is based upon several basic economic forces which i believe 
will be operating in  recent events in the general assembly of the united 
nations confirm that the cold war will remain  with us and probably 
intensify for the foreseeable future.
Sentence 13:  6.094420265583059 
444.
Sentence 14: this makes  it certain that federal expenditures for military 
preparedness and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the 
next several  years.
Sentence 15:  8.463292341995245 
445.
Sentence 16: we are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the
  friendship of the new african nations against the ruthless 
competition of the communist bloc.
Sentence 17: 6.733054333342714 
446.
Sentence 18: our efforts to overcome the lead of the russians in space are bound 
to mean accelerated federal spending.
Sentence 19:  7.190743401679699 
447.
Sentence 20: moreover  it is likely that federal policies aimed at stimulating 
a faster  rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the 
communist  countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is 
better  than theirs will lead to rising federal spending in certain 
areas such as education housing medical aid and the like.
  5.044728134389956 
448.
Sentence 21: there are  serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising 
federal expenditures  of which i take a dim view but it seems very 
likely to occur.
Sentence 22: 8.337015751988256 
449.
Sentence 23: during the sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping
  up in the rate of household formations which should contribute
  to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building.
  6.9996797657686125 
450.
Sentence 24: according  to the latest  projections of the bureau of the census 
the annual rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 
years.
Sentence 25:  7.769677834544098 
451.
Sentence 26: under the most favorable assumptions for increase the bureau of the
  census projects that the annual rate of household formations will 
rise  from about 883000 in the last two years of the fifties to an annual
  rate of about 1018000 in the first five years of the sixties and
Sentence 1:   to a slightly higher annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of 
the  decade.
Sentence 2:  6.287100115120962 
452.
Sentence 3: during the seventies the projections show a more pronounced  rise 
to an annual rate of 1338000 in the second half of that decade.
  10.48537513600651 
453.
Sentence 4: accordingly the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing
  occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance 
the  general economic prospects of the sixties.
Sentence 5:  5.058678593975553 
454.
Sentence 6: however the impact of  a rising rate of household formation this 
decade should not be exaggerated.
Sentence 7: 9.367180306331889 
455.
Sentence 8: the average annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the
  sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1525000 in
  with  the expansion of family formation in the sixties a continued 
substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems
  to be indicated.
Sentence 9: 0.0 
456.
Sentence 10: this is an area in which there is still a large backlog  of demand.
  29.83503936838319 
457.
Sentence 11: state and local expenditures increased  persistently from $26.
  11.045118697824805 
458.
Sentence 12: 5-billion in 1949 to $44.
Sentence 13:  10.472119682746735 
459.
Sentence 14: 3-billion in 1959 and  it would not be surprising if they showed a 
comparable increase in this decade which would carry them to the 
neighborhood of $75-billion by 1970.
Sentence 15:  5.544515918176757 
460.
Sentence 16: here would be a powerful force for raising business activity.
  11.196526552036076 
461.
Sentence 17: the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures
  should continue to move upward from the levels of the fifties.
  6.491403764578628 
462.
Sentence 18: spurred  by keen competition in our industrial system and still 
further  increases in the funds devoted to industrial research plant 
and equipment  expenditures by business and industry should rise during 
the decade.
Sentence 19: 6.261354008608648 
463.
Sentence 20: i suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and 
housing  which was dammed-up during the thirties and world war 2 is 
finally  in the process of running dry.
Sentence 21:  6.396998882318591 
464.
Sentence 22: there is some clear-cut evidence  of this.
Sentence 23:  29.657441313011308 
465.
Sentence 24: for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans  for 
housing under the va home loan guaranty program seems to have largely 
exhausted itself.
Sentence 25:  7.899503569053473 
466.
Sentence 26: indeed the failure of home-building as a  whole to respond this 
year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage  financing and the 
increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and  rising vacancy rates 
in apartment buildings may also signal in part  that the lush days of 
big backlog demand for housing are reaching an  end.
Sentence 27:  5.978533333968285 
467.
Sentence 28: in a way we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of 
automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car
  coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of
  the frills which were accepted in the fifties.
Sentence 29:  6.329886548599659 
468.
Sentence 30: the huge backlog of demand  which was evident in the first decade 
and a half after the war  was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the 
public during the war and  even more so by the easier and easier credit 
in the consumer loan and  home loan fields.
Sentence 31:  7.301164534361352 
469.
Sentence 32: the consuming public has used up a good part of these  liquid 
assets or they have been drained by the rising price level  and we have 
apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer  or home 
mortgage terms easier.
Sentence 33: 6.265151968676248 
470.
Sentence 34: this is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not 
continue to rise in the sixties.
Sentence 35:  17.389249975965875 
Sentence 1: 471.
Sentence 2: i  am confident that it will but consumer spending in the sixties 
will  not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which 
characterized  most of the fifties.
Sentence 3: 0.0 
472.
Sentence 4: markets should become more competitive  as consumers become more 
selective.
Sentence 5: 8.196044167676531 
473.
Sentence 6: accordingly during the sixties our national economy is likely  to 
grow at as fast a rate as in the fifties and in the process to
  require enormous amounts of capital funds.
Sentence 7:  6.7066642067806415 
474.
Sentence 8: wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of
  forces- no single explanation has been found which applies to all 
cases.
Sentence 9:  8.355571022862344 
475.
Sentence 10: the purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which
  has not been treated in the literature but which we believe makes a
  significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a 
few  very important industries.
Sentence 11:  5.109450006460001 
476.
Sentence 12: while there may be several such industries  to which the model of 
this paper is applicable the authors make particular  claim of 
relevance to the explanation of the course of wages  and prices in the 
steel industry of the united states since world  war 2.
  8.264657241765676 
477.
Sentence 13: indeed the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude  in 
the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the  model 
here presented.
Sentence 14:  6.298799455806308 
478.
Sentence 15: the model of this paper considers an industry which is not 
characterized by vigorous price competition but  which is so basic that 
its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public 
scrutiny.
Sentence 16:  6.403496419865711 
479.
Sentence 17: where the industry's product price has been kept below the profit-
maximizing and entry-limiting  prices due to fears of public reaction 
the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real 
resistance to wage demands.
Sentence 18: 5.387003401415467 
480.
Sentence 19: the contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this 
proposition and an exploration of some of its implications.
  9.568470387705613 
481.
Sentence 20: in order  to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force 
which we may call  the effect of public-limit pricing on key wage 
bargains  we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other 
forces  such as union power which may be relevant in an actual 
situation.
Sentence 21: 5.396800420302613 
482.
Sentence 22: for  expository purposes this is best treated as a model which 
spells  out the conditions under which an important industry affected 
with the  public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even 
in the absence  of union pressures for higher wages.
Sentence 23:  5.898567685259947 
483.
Sentence 24: part 1 below describes this abstract model by spelling out its 
assumptions.
Sentence 25:  9.402241878138415 
484.
Sentence 26: part 2 discusses the operation of the model and derives some 
significant conclusions.
Sentence 27:  17.646198622485493 
485.
Sentence 28: part 3 discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of 
the conclusions.
Sentence 29: 9.402241878138415 
486.
Sentence 30: part 4 is a brief summary.
Sentence 31:  18.958301390356997 
487.
Sentence 32: the  mathematical appendix presents the rigorous argument but is 
best read  after part 1 in order that the assumptions underlying the 
equations  may be explicit.
Sentence 33: 5.2588932223382265 
488.
Sentence 34: the industry with which this model is concerned is a  basic 
industry producing a substantial share of gross national product.
  7.680547411047537 
489.
Sentence 35: for the purposes of setting the product price the industry behaves 
as a single entity.
Sentence 36:  7.419583361482161 
490.
Sentence 37: the demand  we are concerned with aggregate  demand for the 
industry's product.
Sentence 38:  10.132857641369208 
Sentence 1: 491.
Sentence 2: the manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given.
  8.391406901283968 
492.
Sentence 3: in any given time period the aggregate  demand for the industry's 
product is determined by two things:  the price charged by the industry 
and the level of gnp.
Sentence 4: 8.284700927658132 
493.
Sentence 5: for  the purposes of this discussion the problem of relative prices 
is encompassed  in these two variables since gnp includes other prices.
  5.851710758842571 
494.
Sentence 6: the form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity 
demanded vary  inversely with the product price and vary directly with 
the level of  gnp.
Sentence 7:  7.914375602143917 
495.
Sentence 8: the industry of  this model is so important that its wage and price 
policies are affected with a public interest.
Sentence 9:  6.445889539651649 
496.
Sentence 10: because of its importance and because the  lack of price 
competition is well recognized the industry is under considerable
  public pressure not to raise its price any more than could  be 
justified by cost increases.
Sentence 11: 7.9186265889259735 
497.
Sentence 12: the threat of effective anti-trust action  provoked by gouging 
the public through price increases not justified by cost increases and 
fears of endangering relations with  customers congress the general 
public and the press all operate  to keep price increases in some 
relation to cost increases.
Sentence 13: 5.211515995650729 
498.
Sentence 14: for the  industry of this model the effect of such public 
pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run 
profit-maximizing  price and even  below the entry-limited price.
  7.882008790015473 
499.
Sentence 15: for  such an industry it is only safe to raise its price if such an
  increase is manifestly justified by rising costs  .
  5.419285728287116 
500.
Sentence 16: thus if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that 
the industry may charge this pressure is itself a function  of the wage 
rate.
Sentence 17: 7.278809401750381 
501.
Sentence 18: in this model we abstract from all non-wage  sources of cost 
changes so that the public-limit price only  rises as the wage rate 
rises.
Sentence 19:  6.675706588318595 
502.
Sentence 20: in such circumstances it may well be  to the advantage of the 
industry to allow an increase in the basic wage  rate.
  11.601488072081608 
503.
Sentence 21: since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises the  profit-
maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated and 
is likely to remain well above the latter.
Sentence 22:  5.436345134758126 
504.
Sentence 23: the entry-limiting  price will also be raised for potential 
domestic competition but  unless general inflation permits profit 
margins to increase proportionately  throughout the economy we might 
expect the public-limit price  to approach the entry-limit price.
  6.515077759849179 
505.
Sentence 24: the foreign-entry-limit price would  be approached more rapidly 
since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign  costs directly.
  6.196120048044738 
506.
Sentence 25: where this approach becomes critical the industry  can be expected 
to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its  sincerity in resisting 
the wage pressures of a powerful union requesting tariff relief after it 
has reluctantly acceded to the union  pressure.
Sentence 26:  6.856003628414112 
507.
Sentence 27: whether or not it is in the industry's interest  to allow the 
basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent  to which 
the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase and the 
relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying  the 
wage increase.
Sentence 28:  6.519434087516143 
508.
Sentence 29: the extent to which the public-limit price  is raised by a given 
increase in the basic wage rate is itself a  function of three things: 
Sentence 1: the passage of time the level of gnp  and the size of the wage 
increase.
Sentence 2:  9.57946891104516 
509.
Sentence 3: we are abstracting from the fact of strikes here but it should be 
obvious that the extent to  which the public-limit price is raised by a 
given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of 
resistance put up by the  industry.
Sentence 4:  6.171101474222841 
510.
Sentence 5: the industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure
 on the union but in order to educate the government and the 
customers of the industry.
Sentence 6:  7.363291223855055 
511.
Sentence 7: as a strike continues these parties increase  their pressure on the 
industry to reach an agreement.
Sentence 8:  8.59397126627422 
512.
Sentence 9: they become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that 
the industry  claims the wage bargain would entail.
Sentence 10:  8.586863099314062 
513.
Sentence 11: public indignation and resistance to wage-price increases is 
obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3% per annum 
than when the increases are on the order of 3% per month.
  5.770461951725361 
514.
Sentence 12: the simple passage of an additional  eleven months' time makes 
the second 3% boost more acceptable.
Sentence 13:  8.510875472925726 
515.
Sentence 14: thus  the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage 
increase  the longer it has been since the previous price increase.
  5.560711424636097 
516.
Sentence 15: notice however  that the passage of time does not permit the 
raising of prices  per se without an accompanying wage increase.
  7.964328543437645 
517.
Sentence 16: similarly higher levels of gnp do not in themselves provide grounds 
for raising prices but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry 
so that  it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase.
  6.355777933746499 
518.
Sentence 17: this is not extended to anticipated levels of gnp however- only the 
current  level of gnp affects the public pressure against wage-price 
increases.
Sentence 18: 8.291928358643258 
519.
Sentence 19: finally since the public requires some restraint on the part  of 
the companies larger wage increases call for less than proportionately
  larger price increases a price increase of 7% a wage increase of 10% 
allows a price  .
Sentence 20:  4.794951715532896 
520.
Sentence 21: we  assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of 
operation  is constant with respect to quantity produced    and 
is the same for every firm.
Sentence 22: 7.175602276588529 
521.
Sentence 23: the level of this average cost is determined by factor prices 
technology and so forth.
Sentence 24:  7.413864179236019 
522.
Sentence 25: as we have noted however we are abstracting  from changes in all 
determinants of this level except for changes in  the wage rate.
  9.210511820020196 
523.
Sentence 26: the level of average cost is e.
Sentence 27:  11.903366396315082 
524.
Sentence 28: union policies and collective  the single union which faces the 
industry  does not restrict its membership and there is an adequate 
supply  of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going 
wage rate.
Sentence 29: 6.962842864600112 
525.
Sentence 30: the union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a 
matter  of concern when setting its own wage policy- its concern with 
employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain
  full employment.
Sentence 31: 5.555803646439296 
526.
Sentence 32: the union vigorously demands wage increases from  productivity 
increases and wage increases to offset cost-of-living  increases but we 
abstract from these forces here.
Sentence 33:  7.210955619203047 
527.
Sentence 34: for our present  purposes we assume that the sole subject of 
bargaining is the basic wage rate  and it is this basic wage rate which 
determines the  level of costs.
Sentence 35:  6.343945375272807 
Sentence 1: 528.
Sentence 2: productivity is something of an amorphous concept and  the amount 
of productivity increase in a given time period is not even  well known 
to the industry much less to the union or to the public.
  6.8484665797081865 
529.
Sentence 3: disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the
  problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a 
productivity  increase should be shared.
Sentence 4:  5.796116151346321 
530.
Sentence 5: the existence of conflict and of  vigorous union demand for an 
increase in money wages does not contradict  the assumption that the 
union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity-share 
increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase in the basic wage 
rate.
Sentence 6: 7.328733749567969 
531.
Sentence 7: we assume further that the union  recognizes the possibility that 
price-level increases may offset wage-rate  increases and it does not 
entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own 
wage increases upon the real wage rate.
Sentence 8: 5.465702329130352 
532.
Sentence 9: for internal political reasons the union asks for  increases in the 
basic wage rate and would vigorously oppose  a reduction in this rate but 
the adjustment of the basic wage rate  upwards is essentially up to the 
discretion of the companies of the industry.
Sentence 10: 6.776597605551481 
533.
Sentence 11: changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising and they constitute 
an argument for raising prices.
Sentence 12: 6.174387796979883 
534.
Sentence 13: however it is not known to either the union or the public precisely 
how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage 
rate although the  companies are presumed to have reliable estimates 
of this magnitude.
Sentence 14:  8.131445400735494 
535.
Sentence 15: in this model then the industry is presumed to realize that  they 
could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate but since such 
a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may  in 
circumstances to be spelled out in part 2 below find it to  their 
advantage to allow the wage rise.
Sentence 16: 5.529126206527752 
536.
Sentence 17: thus for non-negative changes  in the basic wage rate the 
industry becomes the active wage-setter since any increase in the basic 
wage rate can occur only by reason  of industry acquiescence.
  6.748795274769756 
537.
Sentence 18: the presumption in the literature would appear  to be that the 
basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case on the grounds that it is 
clearly not in the interest of the industry  to raise wages gratuitously.
 6.588114579360091 
538.
Sentence 19: from this presumption it is an easy  step to the conclusion that 
any observed increases in the basic wage rate  must be due to union 
behavior different and more aggressive than assumed  in our model.
  7.314295058018685 
539.
Sentence 20: it is this conclusion that we challenge; we do  so by disproving 
the presumption on which it is based.
Sentence 21:  9.319725633419784 
540.
Sentence 22: of the model  it is convenient to assume that the union-industry
  contract is of one year's duration.
Sentence 23:  10.944772266895875 
541.
Sentence 24: in the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became 
international  law.
Sentence 25:  9.931625484358362 
542.
Sentence 26: several factors contributed to this change.
Sentence 27:  11.107336869440822 
543.
Sentence 28: the  congress of vienna is a convenient starting point because it 
both  epitomized and symbolized what was to follow.
Sentence 29:  5.236383152695367 
544.
Sentence 30: here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for 
europe but for the world.
Sentence 31:  10.59089513322992 
545.
Sentence 32: thus the congress marks a formal recognition of the political system
  that was central to world politics for a century.
Sentence 33:  7.076798287833172 
546.
Sentence 34: international  law had to fit the conditions of europe and 
nothing that could not fit this  system or the interests of the great 
european nations collectively  could possibly emerge as law in any 
meaningful sense.
Sentence 35:  7.649294764530398 
Sentence 1: 547.
Sentence 2: essentially this imposed two conditions: first international law had 
to recognize  and be compatible with an international political system 
in which  a number of states were competitive suspicious and 
opportunistic  in their political alignments with one another; second 
it had to  be compatible with the value system that they shared.
  4.433462393909312 
548.
Sentence 3: in both respects international law was europeanized.
  16.97769984606414 
549.
Sentence 4: it was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would 
square the two conditions.
Sentence 5:  9.265494440764135 
550.
Sentence 6: on the one hand the major european nations had to maintain vis-a-vis
  each other an emphasis upon sovereignty independence formal 
equality-  thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom 
of  action to maintain the flexibility of alignment that the system
  required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the 
disastrous napoleonic experience.
Sentence 7: 7.368190119787844 
551.
Sentence 8: but there was no pressing need to maintain  these same standards 
with regard to most of the rest of the world.
Sentence 9:  14.057053281171957 
552.
Sentence 10: thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the
  smaller european states did not really comfortably fit less 
developed  and less powerful societies elsewhere.
Sentence 11: 6.5712493751857 
553.
Sentence 12: political interference in africa  and asia and even in latin 
america  by the special interest of the united states as expressed in
  the monroe doctrine itself from the outset related to european 
politics  was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values
  and the european balance itself.
Sentence 13:  6.141119012741397 
554.
Sentence 14: a nation such as switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and 
could be relied upon to protect  its neutrality; more doubtful but 
possible  was the neutralization of the latin american countrie s; out 
of the question was the neutralization of asia and africa.
  6.45528978557147 
555.
Sentence 15: this europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of
  19th century scholars.
Sentence 16: 7.336738903232112 
556.
Sentence 17: more emphasis was put upon the fact that international  law was the 
law of civilized nations; kent and story  the great early american 
scholars repeatedly made use of this phrase  or of christian nations 
which is a substantial equivalent.
Sentence 18:  8.09091364691852 
557.
Sentence 19: wheaton stated that the public law was essentially limited to the
  civilized and christian peoples of europe or to those of european
  origin.
Sentence 20:  5.5870627374518325 
558.
Sentence 21: of course it had always been of european origin in fact  but it had 
maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory.
  9.497917051732287 
559.
Sentence 22: now with virtually every writer not only was the european origin
  of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon but the rules
  thus established by the advanced civilizations of europe were to be 
imposed  on others.
Sentence 23: 5.516751111784525 
560.
Sentence 24: the european customs on which international law was based were to 
become by force and fiat the customs that others were  to accept as law 
if they were to join this community as sovereign states.
  6.8287946646636275 
561.
Sentence 25: hall for example was quite explicit on this point when he said
  states outside european civilization must formally enter into the
  circle of law-governed countries.
Sentence 26: 5.031061973382939 
562.
Sentence 27: they must do something with the  acquiescence of the latter or 
some of them which amounts to an acceptance  of the law in its entirety 
beyond all possibility of misconstruction.
Sentence 28:  8.547440744412572 
563.
Sentence 29: during the nineteenth century these views were protested by
  virtually all the latin american writers though ineffectively just
Sentence 1:   as the new nations of africa and asia protest them with more effect
  today.
Sentence 2:  6.633074813899798 
564.
Sentence 3: a number of other nineteenth-century developments  contributed  to 
the transmutation of the law of nations into international  law; that 
is from aspects of a universal system of justice into  particular rules 
governing the relations of sovereign states.
Sentence 4: 8.96969692551629 
565.
Sentence 5: the difference  is important for although the older law of nations 
did cover  relationships among sovereigns this was by no means its 
exclusive domain.
Sentence 6:  5.800747303873487 
566.
Sentence 7: the law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their 
own citizens to foreigners and to each other in a conceptually
  unified system.
Sentence 8:  10.579873523647176 
567.
Sentence 9: the theory of international law which in the nineteenth  century 
became common to virtually all writers in europe and america  broke this 
unity and this universality.
Sentence 10: 6.413080507903362 
568.
Sentence 11: it lost sight of the  individual almost entirely and confined 
itself to rules limiting the exercise  of state power for reasons 
essentially unconnected with justice  or morality save as these values 
might affect international relations.
Sentence 12:  6.869095168730342 
569.
Sentence 13: no longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine
  what he ought to do; his search was merely for rules that might 
limit his freedom of action.
Sentence 14: 5.806997634055077 
570.
Sentence 15: to appreciate this development we must relate it to other aspects 
of nineteenth-century philosophy.
Sentence 16: 8.985884733762152 
571.
Sentence 17: first and most obvious was the growing nationalism and the tendency 
to  regard the state and the individual's identification with the state
  as transcending other ties of social solidarity.
Sentence 18:  5.662242888225814 
572.
Sentence 19: national identification was not new but it was accelerating in 
intensity and scope throughout  europe as new unifications occurred.
  7.758550376765831 
573.
Sentence 20: it reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of state 
will put forward by  the germans especially by hegel although political 
philosophers will  recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of 
hobbes.
Sentence 21:  5.437096434310103 
574.
Sentence 22: national  identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law 
theories which  incorporated this hegelian abstraction and saw law 
domestic and international  simply as its formal reflection.
  6.290129093830134 
575.
Sentence 23: in the international community  this reduced law to jellinek's 
auto-limitation.
Sentence 24: 10.466002073342645 
576.
Sentence 25: a state the highest form of human organization in fact and theory 
could be subjected  to law only by a manifestation of self-will or 
consent.
Sentence 26:  7.110216203716876 
577.
Sentence 27: according  to the new theories the nineteenth century corporate 
sovereign  was sovereign in a quite new and different sense from his 
historical predecessors.
Sentence 28:  6.598466918976268 
578.
Sentence 29: he no longer sought to find the law; he made it;  he could be 
subjected to law only because he agreed to be.
Sentence 30:  8.50328803992675 
579.
Sentence 31: there was  no law domestic or international except that willed by 
acknowledged  by or consented to by states.
Sentence 32:  7.114600149770193 
580.
Sentence 33: hidden behind hegelian abstractions  were more practical reasons 
for a changing jurisprudence.
Sentence 34:  7.615092762846159 
581.
Sentence 35: related  to but distinguishable from nationalism was the growth 
of democracy  in one form or another.
Sentence 36:  6.2553469477383485 
582.
Sentence 37: increased participation in politics and the demands of various 
groups for status and recognition had dramatic  effects upon law 
institutions.
Sentence 38: 6.54093796655646 
583.
Sentence 39: the efforts of various interest groups  to control or influence 
governmental decisions particularly when  taken in conjunction with 
the impact of industralization led to a concentration  of attention on 
Sentence 1: the legislative power and the means whereby  policy could be formulated 
and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions.
Sentence 2:  5.736287051074467 
584.
Sentence 3: law became a conscious process something more than simply  doing 
justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for
  applicable norms.
Sentence 4:  6.559337496133126 
585.
Sentence 5: particularly was this true when the norms previously  applied 
were no longer satisfactory to many when customs were rapidly changing as 
the forces of the new productivity were harnessed.
Sentence 6: 5.491981963951048 
586.
Sentence 7: the  old way of doing things which depended on a relatively stable 
community  with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations was no 
longer  adequate to the task.
Sentence 8: 6.09983039226678 
587.
Sentence 9: first was the period of codification of existing  law: the code 
napoleon in france and the peculiar codification  that in fact resulted 
from austin's restatement and ordering of  the common law in england.
  5.906828534379776 
588.
Sentence 10: codification was followed in all countries  by a growing amount of 
legislation some changing and adjusting the older law much dealing with 
entirely new situations.
Sentence 11:  6.157942065974489 
589.
Sentence 12: the legislative  mills have been grinding ever since and when its 
cumbersome processes  were no longer adequate to the task a limited 
legislative authority was delegated in one form or another to the 
executive.
Sentence 13: 4.908401855518352 
590.
Sentence 14: whereas  the eighteenth century had been a time in which man 
sought justice the  nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in 
which men are satisfied  with law.
Sentence 15:  7.448313248280783 
591.
Sentence 16: indeed with developed positivism the separation of law  from 
justice or from morality generally became quite specific.
  5.8021300063904535 
592.
Sentence 17: in municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as
  fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the 
power of parliament- the elected representatives- at the expense of the
  more conservative judiciary.
Sentence 18: 7.306761231795977 
593.
Sentence 19: when the power of the latter was made  both limited and explicit- 
when norms were clarified and made more precise  and the creation of 
new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary  hands- two purposes 
were served: government was made subservient to an institutionalized 
popular will and law became a rational system for implementing that will 
for serving conscious goals for embodying  the public policy.
  5.440480453301142 
594.
Sentence 20: it is true that initially the task was to remove restrictions that 
it was thought inhibited the free flow of money goods and labor; but even 
laissez-faire was a conscious  policy.
Sentence 21:  9.614481769026716 
595.
Sentence 22: law was seen as an emanation of the sovereign will.
Sentence 23: 6.661604752959209 
596.
Sentence 24: however the sovereign was not hobbes' absolute monarch but rather
  the parliamentary sovereign of austin.
Sentence 25: 8.890041874635154 
597.
Sentence 26: it was too an optimistic  philosophy and though it separated law 
from morality it was by no means  an immoral or amoral one.
  7.01808663325341 
598.
Sentence 27: man through democratic institutions  of government and economic 
freedom was master of his destiny.
Sentence 28:  8.582490004035838 
599.
Sentence 29: the theory  did not require though it unfortunately might acquire a 
hegelian  mystique.
Sentence 30:  7.098087065137257 
600.
Sentence 31: it was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions
  of popular government.
Sentence 32: 12.325109250313941 
601.
Sentence 33: it was not opposed to either justice  or morality; it merely 
wished to minimize subjective views of officials  who wielded public 
authority.
Sentence 34: 7.6621748616035825 
602.
Sentence 35: particularly was this true as  laissez-faire capitalism became 
the dominant credo of western society.
Sentence 36: 7.810415301301886 
Sentence 1: 603.
Sentence 2: to free the factors of production was a major objective of the 
rising  bourgeoisie and this objective required that governmental 
authority- administrative officials and judges- be limited as precisely
  and explicitly as possible; that old customs which inhibited trade 
be  abrogated; that business be free from governmental supervision and
  notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of 
the  free market; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with
  the new politics and the new economics be done away with.
  4.452182971540685 
604.
Sentence 3: contract-  conceived as the free bargain of formal equals- replaced 
the implied obligations of a more static and status-conscious society.
  7.233605218877253 
605.
Sentence 4: indeed contract was the dominant legal theme of the century the 
touchstone of the free society.
Sentence 5:  6.873767108287194 
606.
Sentence 6: government itself was based upon contract; business organization- the 
corporation- was analyzed in contractual terms;  trade was based on 
freedom of contract and money was lent and  borrowed on contractual 
terms; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual 
arrangement.
Sentence 7:  6.363875850014182 
607.
Sentence 8: it is not surprising that the international  obligations of states 
were also viewed in terms of contract.
Sentence 9: 10.588561735085145 
608.
Sentence 10: in  fact some- anzilotti is the principle example- went so far as
  to say that all international law could be traced to the single 
legal norm pacta sunt servanda.
Sentence 11:  6.9957381580628155 
609.
Sentence 12: the displacement of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth
  and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international 
law  theory and doctrine.
Sentence 13:  5.780140237098333 
610.
Sentence 14: in the first place the new doctrine brought  a  formal separation 
of international from municipal law rejecting the earlier  view that 
both were parts of a universal legal system.
Sentence 15: 8.808409683008206 
611.
Sentence 16: one result  was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the 
law of nations.
Sentence 17:  9.620783781909985 
612.
Sentence 18: admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problems which arise
  in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign 
country  were all severed from the older law of nations and made 
dependent  on the several national laws.
Sentence 19:  5.981212406117234 
613.
Sentence 20: private international law  was thus segregated from international
  law proper or as it is often called public international law.
  6.885184906384749 
614.
Sentence 21: states were free to enact within broad though determinate
  limits their own rules as to the application of foreign law by 
their courts to vary the law merchant and to enact legislation with 
regard  to many claims arising on the high seas.
Sentence 22:  6.285259729134857 
615.
Sentence 23: the change was not quite  so dramatic as it sounds because in 
fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were 
only gradually changed by legislation  and then largely in marginal 
situations.
Sentence 24: 4.983969984190278 
616.
Sentence 25: mr justice black was one of the minority that rested on the article
  1 power.
Sentence 26:  11.318938631307228 
617.
Sentence 27: in this view supported by only three members of the court a power 
denied by the specific provisions of article 3  was granted by the 
generality of article 1.
Sentence 28:  6.596696470822481 
618.
Sentence 29: if this seems arbitrary its effect was to treat citizens of the 
district of columbia equally with citizens of the states- at the expense 
of expanding a troublesome  jurisdiction.
Sentence 30:  8.649624649458028 
619.
Sentence 31: for almost  a hundred years we relied upon state courts  for the 
protection of most rights arising under national  law.
Sentence 32:  6.062694230526357 
620.
Sentence 33: then in 1875 apparently in response to the nationalizing influence 
of the civil war congress first gave the lower federal courts general 
Sentence 1: authority- concurrently with state tribunals- to decide cases involving 
federal-right questions.
Sentence 2:  8.091251517131603 
621.
Sentence 3: one purpose of the change  was to attain sympathetic enforcement 
of rights insured by the civil  war amendments against state 
interference.
Sentence 4:  6.4441271001144615 
622.
Sentence 5: serious difficulty arose  with the advent of substantive due 
process.
Sentence 6:  8.843367331156275 
623.
Sentence 7: an amendment presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly 
freed slaves became  a laissez-faire limitation upon state economic 
policy.
Sentence 8:  6.9640844673372415 
624.
Sentence 9: a flood  of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the 
processes of  local government.
Sentence 10:  8.40106343233402 
625.
Sentence 11: congress reacted with a series of measures modifying  in various 
ways what it had granted in 1875.
Sentence 12: 6.2016166993573245 
626.
Sentence 13: in 1910 it required the convening of a special three-judge court for 
the issuance of certain  injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the 
supreme court.
Sentence 14:  8.160106390452345 
627.
Sentence 15: such  legislation was clarified and extended from time to time 
thereafter.
Sentence 16: 7.795383746932392 
628.
Sentence 17: in 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal 
injunction proceedings upon institution of state court test cases.
  8.482212948039292 
629.
Sentence 18: the essential  ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 
in substantial  elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state 
public utility rate  orders.
Sentence 19:  5.670580783382225 
630.
Sentence 20: three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions
  against collection of state taxes.
Sentence 21:  8.371670676500804 
631.
Sentence 22: this saved for state adjudication in the first instance the two 
major areas where federal injunctions  had been most obnoxious but other 
areas remained vulnerable.
Sentence 23:  5.736786668550141 
632.
Sentence 24: meanwhile the supreme court like congress showed misgivings
  concerning this aspect of government by injunction.
  9.061818430428321 
633.
Sentence 25: drawing upon  the traditional discretion of the chancellor mr 
justice holmes  introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints 
that culminated  in mr justice frankfurter's famous doctrine of 
abstention.
Sentence 26: 5.076847533455262 
634.
Sentence 27: whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the 
availability  of adequate state remedies the new emphasis is upon the 
nature of  the state policy at issue.
Sentence 28:  6.458755637005268 
635.
Sentence 29: the classic case is railroad commission v pullman.
Sentence 30: 9.377114209797627 
636.
Sentence 31: the commission had issued an administrative order  which was 
challenged as discriminatory against negroes.
Sentence 32:  9.45273821686523 
637.
Sentence 33: its enforcement  was enjoined by a federal trial court.
  7.432382072063545 
638.
Sentence 34: on review the supreme  court via mr justice frankfurter found 
southern racial problems  a sensitive area of social policy on which 
the federal courts ought  not to enter unless no alternative to h 
adjudication is open.
Sentence 35: 6.757773177684674 
639.
Sentence 36: an alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether
  the offending order had in fact been authorized.
Sentence 37:  6.135225267642463 
640.
Sentence 38: reluctant as usual  to interpret state legislation- such 
interpretation can only be  a forecast rather than a determination- mr 
justice frankfurter  led a unanimous court to vacate the injunction.
  6.324432667118434 
641.
Sentence 39: but it is crucial that here unlike burford the trial court was 
ordered to retain  the case until the state courts had had a 
reasonable opportunity to settle the state-law question.
Sentence 40: 6.834754824926213 
Sentence 1: 642.
Sentence 2: the resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid 
the waste of a tentative decision as  well as the friction of a 
premature constitutional adjudication.
Sentence 3: 6.830397971433521 
643.
Sentence 4: temporary abstention ie postponement is one thing; refusal to 
adjudicate is another.
Sentence 5: 6.002446559592496 
644.
Sentence 6: to the extent that the jurisdictional  principle of 1875 stands 
unmodified by subsequent legislation federal equitable relief against 
state action must be available- or so  it seems to mr justice 
frankfurter.
Sentence 7:  7.40347327650156 
645.
Sentence 8: in alabama public service  commission v southern ry co the 
commission had  refused to permit abandonment of certain uneconomic 
train facilities.
Sentence 9:  6.012361463777105 
646.
Sentence 10: the railroad claiming deprivation of property without due process
  of law sought injunctive relief.
Sentence 11:  8.346523409839932 
647.
Sentence 12: the court held that federal  jurisdiction should not be exercised 
lest the domestic policy of the state  be obstructed; this in the name 
of equitable discretion.
Sentence 13:  9.128661418672582 
648.
Sentence 14: justices frankfurter and jackson concurred in the court's result
  for they found no merit in the railroad's claim.
Sentence 15:  6.643215071337043 
649.
Sentence 16: but they objected vigorously to the proposition that federal courts 
may refuse to exercise jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of congress:   
by  one fell swoop the court now finds that congress indulged in 
needless  legislation in the acts of 1910 1913 1925 1934 and 1937.
  4.948211519546795 
650.
Sentence 17: by  these measures congress so the court in effect now decides 
gave  not only needless but inadequate relief since it now appears that
  the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the act of 1875 
against  all proceedings challenging local regulation.
  5.746588852777003 
651.
Sentence 18: a most revealing recent case is textile workers union v lincoln
  mills.
Sentence 19:  7.190017756155806 
652.
Sentence 20: the taft-hartley act gave the federal courts jurisdiction  over 
suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a  labor 
organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce.
  6.605761073447593 
653.
Sentence 21: on its face this merely provides a federal forum; it does  not 
establish any law for the federal judges to enforce.
Sentence 22:  5.84258359218675 
654.
Sentence 23: how  can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights 
when congress  has created none?  7.391013650626644 
655.
Sentence 24:  the court held that congress had intended  the federal judiciary 
to fashion an appropriate law of labor-management  contracts.
  7.930088552995078 
656.
Sentence 25: in short congressional power to grant federal-question  authority 
to federal courts is now apparently so broad that congress  need not 
create or specify the right to be enforced.
Sentence 26:  7.729890560022165 
657.
Sentence 27: the lincoln mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal
  common law which as mr justice frankfurter pointed out  in dissent 
leads to one of the following incongruities: conflict in federal and 
state court interpretations of collective  bargaining agreements; 
displacement of state law by federal law  in state courts h in all 
actions regarding collective bargaining agreements;  or exclusion of 
state court jurisdiction over these matters.
Sentence 28: 4.986091856538282 
658.
Sentence 29: the justice's elaborate examination of the legislative history  of 
the provision in question suggests that congress' purpose  was merely 
to make unions suable.
Sentence 30: 6.955804554600195 
659.
Sentence 31: with a few exceptions the lawmakers  seemed unaware of the 
technical problems of federal jurisdiction  involved- to say nothing of 
the delegation of lawmaking power to judges.
Sentence 32: 6.38148884954061 
Sentence 1: 660.
Sentence 2: to avoid these constitutional difficulties mr justice frankfurter
  was prepared to read the taft-hartley provision as concerned  with 
diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction.
Sentence 3:  7.526093915719312 
661.
Sentence 4: this  would satisfy what presumably was congress' major purpose- the 
suability  of unions.
Sentence 5: 6.002446559592496 
662.
Sentence 6: it would also leave intact the states' traditional authority in the 
realm of contract law.
Sentence 7: 13.670035913708034 
663.
Sentence 8: and york decisions require federal courts in diversity cases  here 
again mr justice frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of 
wholesale judicial  legislation.
Sentence 9:  5.998727237315507 
664.
Sentence 10: if congress wants to displace the states from areas which they have 
customarily occupied let it do so knowingly and explicitly.
  7.547626412291326 
665.
Sentence 11: and let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal
  judges.
Sentence 12:  7.195806614831201 
666.
Sentence 13: does lincoln mills suggest that if congress granted jurisdiction
  over interstate divorce cases the federal courts would be
  authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of 
marriages? 7.009568153780609 
667.
Sentence 14:  there is a common problem behind most of these federal question
  and diversity cases.
Sentence 15:  6.308942906593172 
668.
Sentence 16: congress has not clearly defined the bounds  between state and 
federal court competence.
Sentence 17:  8.55795084636185 
669.
Sentence 18: it has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter 
for solution by judges on  a case-by-case basis.
Sentence 19: 9.768059765417965 
670.
Sentence 20: a careful student has suggested that in any  new revision of the 
judicial code the legislators would do well  to remember that the 
allocation of power to the federal courts should  be limited to those 
matters in which their expertise in federal law  might be used leaving 
to the state judiciaries the primary obligation  of pronouncing state 
law.
Sentence 21:  6.1626295077968525 
671.
Sentence 22: obviously the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in mr 
justice frankfurter's opinions- to  the extent that congress leaves 
the problem to judicial discretion.
Sentence 23:  5.439876757492909 
672.
Sentence 24: the same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in
  the fela certiorari cases in the administrative law area and indeed 
in the whole realm of judicial review.
Sentence 25: 7.471042682756322 
673.
Sentence 26: mr justice black no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to 
make exceptions to  achieve a generous and just result.
  5.475825608292139 
674.
Sentence 27: he will not be fooled  by technicalities.
Sentence 28:  22.184678737871383 
675.
Sentence 29: with few  exceptions congress has not given federal courts 
exclusive authority  to enforce rights arising under federal law.
  6.21477470017956 
676.
Sentence 30: to put it differently  state and federal courts have concurrent 
jurisdiction with respect  to most claims of federal right.
  9.318478032457165 
677.
Sentence 31: to insure uniformity in the meaning  of national law however 
state interpretations are subject to supreme court review.
  6.093144786683763 
678.
Sentence 32: it may be noted parenthetically that to evade desegregation  an 
ex-justice and former southern governor has urged  congress to abolish 
this reviewing authority.
Sentence 33:  9.768417744115498 
679.
Sentence 34: the result of course  would be that federal law inevitably would 
mean different things in  different states.
Sentence 35:  8.53640913803731 
680.
Sentence 36: it would also probably mean different things within the same state- 
depending upon what court rendered  decision.
Sentence 37:  11.022160136999576 
681.
Sentence 38: we consider here only a few of many problems involved  in this 
crucial federal-state relationship.
Sentence 39:  8.937712413973937 
Sentence 1: 682.
Sentence 2: the first is that enforcement  of national law in state 
litigation raises in reverse the old  diversity puzzle of the relation 
of procedure to substance.
Sentence 3:  7.427227232736106 
683.
Sentence 4: subject to  certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair 
trials each level  of government is free to devise its own judicial 
procedures.
Sentence 5: 5.688768559615062 
684.
Sentence 6: litigants  who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go 
into that  court subject to its rules of procedure.
Sentence 7:  6.703888492474915 
685.
Sentence 8: a similar canon applies to those  who press state claims in federal 
tribunals eg in diversity  cases.
Sentence 9:  6.20469847978654 
686.
Sentence 10: in an fela  controversy the state court followed established state 
procedure  by construing a vague complaint most strongly against the 
complainant.
Sentence 11:  8.144935308854754 
687.
Sentence 12: in other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon  the 
pleader by state law.
Sentence 13: 10.806022916250093 
688.
Sentence 14: the result was that the plaintiff's case  was dismissed.
  17.557469861921223 
689.
Sentence 15: mr justice black led a reversing majority: strict  local rules of 
pleading cannot be used to impose unnecessary burdens  upon rights of 
recovery authorized by federal law.
Sentence 16:  5.50077428060064 
690.
Sentence 17: here as  in the byrd case another element of state procedure was 
subsumed  to federal judge-made law.
Sentence 18:  8.168656102496268 
691.
Sentence 19: justices frankfurter and jackson dissented:  one state may cherish 
formalities more than another one state may be more responsive than 
another to procedural reforms.
Sentence 20:  4.903693293796623 
692.
Sentence 21: if  a litigant chooses to enforce a federal right in a state court 
he  cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are 
plaintiffs who  press like claims arising under state law with regard to 
the form  in which the claim must be stated- the particularity for 
instance  with which a cause of action must be described.
  6.0787118207407165 
693.
Sentence 22: federal law though invoked  in a state court delimits the federal 
claim- defines what  gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove 
it.
Sentence 23:  5.321182526784233 
694.
Sentence 24: but the form in  which the claim must be stated need not be 
different from what the state  exacts in the enforcement of like 
obligations created by it so long as a requirement does not add to or 
diminish the right as defined  by federal law nor burden the 
realization of this right in the actualities of litigation.
  6.640919829430761 
695.
Sentence 25: another problem in the area of federal-state  relationships is this: 
what constitutes reversible error in  a state decision?
  7.618675711827995 
696.
Sentence 26:  terminiello v chicago involved a conviction  for disorderly conduct 
under a local ordinance.
Sentence 27:  7.391013650626644 
697.
Sentence 28: the conduct in question was a speech.
Sentence 29:  9.802060557618772 
698.
Sentence 30: the accused did not object to the trial court's  charge to the 
jury that discourse may constitute a breach of  the peace if it stirs 
the public to anger invites dispute brings about  a condition of unrest 
h.
Sentence 31:  6.678516632233705 
699.
Sentence 32: for present purposes it may be assumed  that this charge so narrowly 
limited speech as to violate the federal  constitution.
  6.650938479010989 
700.
Sentence 33: though the accused raised many other objections he did not object on 
this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings.
Sentence 34:  7.621359693134935 
701.
Sentence 35: that is he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his
  case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal 
right.
Sentence 36:  7.581696088016995 
702.
Sentence 37: how else can one explain for example allowing the survival of the 
right to amortize bond discount and premium but not  the right to 
Sentence 1: amortize bond issue expenses; or allowing a deduction  for payment of 
certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization  but 
not a deduction for theft losses  sustained by a transferor prior to a 
reorganization but discovered  after it; or requiring a transferor to 
carry over its method of depeciation  but not allowing rapid 
amortization of  emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization; or 
allowing survival  of a dividend carryover to a personal holding 
company  381 but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes?
  5.430461447675593 
703.
Sentence 2:  these items and most of the others listed above seem  quite 
comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section
  381.
Sentence 3:  6.634885315513075 
704.
Sentence 4: there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction
  either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of
 tax-avoidance possibilities.
Sentence 5: 14.753173423342616 
705.
Sentence 6: with respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 
viewed in historical perspective suggest  a rule requiring survival 
whether the items are beneficial or detrimental  to the surviving 
corporation.
Sentence 7:  5.559283008340014 
706.
Sentence 8: to this extent some stretching  of the literal meaning of the 
committee report seems justified since the literal meaning conflicts 
with the clear implication if not the  language of the statute.
  7.652542745764144 
707.
Sentence 9: it is not contended that section  381 should prescribe the survival 
of all of the transferor's tax attributes.
Sentence 10:  11.727342546857113 
708.
Sentence 11: such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction
  of the statute alone; it would certainly violate the intention of
  congress as expressed in the committee report; and in at least
  one instance involving refund claims it might be contrary to 
another  provision of the united states code.
Sentence 12:  8.522585692541186 
709.
Sentence 13: section  203 of the united states code voids an assignment of a 
claim against  the government unless made after it has been allowed the 
amount due has been ascertained and a warrant for its payment has been 
issued.
Sentence 14:  5.642704308197593 
710.
Sentence 15: if it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions this
  section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring 
corporation for  taxes paid by a transferor corporation even though the 
reorganization  meets the requirements of section 381.
Sentence 16: 7.498761370764141 
711.
Sentence 17: a clearly recognized  exception is a statutory merger or 
consolidation.
Sentence 18:  7.563545188002981 
712.
Sentence 19: the leading case seaboard air line railway v united states held 
that  the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the 
transferor and it has been consistently followed.
Sentence 20: 7.138324771884965 
713.
Sentence 21: the court said the purpose  of the section was principally to spare 
the government the embarrassment  and trouble of dealing with several 
parties one of them a stranger to the claim and to prevent traffic in 
claims particularly tenuous claims against the government.
  5.5722779872812565 
714.
Sentence 22: neither reason said the court applied  to the case at hand; 
furthermore congress could not be presumed  to have intended to obstruct 
mergers approved by the states.
Sentence 23:  7.262193183316376 
715.
Sentence 24: other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors 
corporate dissolutions transfers by descent or transfers by subrogation.
  6.441787998303965 
716.
Sentence 25: exceptions  are often classified as transfers by operation of law.
  8.196044167676531 
717.
Sentence 26: a tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or 
consolidation  statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into 
an operation  of law mold.
Sentence 27:  6.428042594137934 
Sentence 1: 718.
Sentence 2: although it is in some ways comparable to  a voluntary sale of 
assets for cash to which section 203 quite clearly applies the courts and 
treasury have held that acquiring corporations  in several types of 
non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund  of taxes paid by 
transferors.
Sentence 3:  7.1967541645501045 
719.
Sentence 4: a recent case in point is mitchell canneries v united states in 
which a claim against the government  was transferred first from a 
corporation to a partnership whose  partners were former stockholders 
and then to another corporation formed by the partners.
Sentence 5:  0.0 
720.
Sentence 6: holding the final corporation entitled to sue on  the claim the 
court cited the seaboard novo trading and roomberg cases for the 
proposition that h transfers by operation  of law or in conjunction 
with changes of corporate structure are not  assignments prohibited by 
the statute.
Sentence 7:  5.757453938655412 
721.
Sentence 8: in an earlier case  kingan + co v united states an american 
corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a british 
corporation in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the british
  corporation.
Sentence 9:  5.968420493411964 
722.
Sentence 10: the anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the  american 
corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the british
  corporation.
Sentence 11:  7.500466656432886 
723.
Sentence 12: the transaction presumably would have qualified under  section 368 
as a contractual reorganization followed  by a section 332 liquidation 
but not under section 368  as a statutory merger of consolidation.
  5.086785850344256 
724.
Sentence 13: the court nevertheless relied  on the seaboard case and also 
mentioned that the shareholders  of the two corporations were the same.
  7.710501149062964 
725.
Sentence 14: in substance said the court  there was no transfer of equitable 
title.
Sentence 15:  7.8924097041785695 
726.
Sentence 16: the treasury arrives  at substantially the same conclusion but 
skirts the problem of section  203 of the united states code.
  12.00857468294896 
727.
Sentence 17: revenue ruling 54-17 provides  that if the corporation against 
which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a 
successor corporation a claim for refund  should be filed by the 
successor in the name and on behalf of the  corporation which paid the 
tax followed by the name of the successor  corporation.
  5.483503900639054 
728.
Sentence 18: proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also  be 
filed.
Sentence 19:  8.574928159153368 
729.
Sentence 20: if the succession is a matter of public record certificates  of 
the secretaries of state or other public officials having custody  of 
the documents will suffice; if the succession is not of record  all 
documents relating to such succession properly certified are  required.
  5.583164282154521 
730.
Sentence 21: the former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger  or 
consolidation the latter to a contractual acquisition.
Sentence 22:  8.185228423961119 
731.
Sentence 23: the ruling  would not however apply to an acquisition of assets for 
cash.
Sentence 24: 6.817408452020724 
732.
Sentence 25: a recent  ruling although rather confusing cites and follows rev 
rul 54-17.
Sentence 26:  9.12172255696927 
733.
Sentence 27: the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory  or 
contractual reorganization.
Sentence 28: 6.88426636131984 
734.
Sentence 29: hence a successor corporation  in a c reorganization appears 
entitled to sue for a refund of taxes  paid by the merged corporation 
despite section 203.
Sentence 30:  6.8750612108477425 
735.
Sentence 31: in a b reorganization followed by a section 332 liquidation those 
cases which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in 
Sentence 1: liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund 
of taxes  paid by the transferor.
Sentence 2:  5.534405781745756 
736.
Sentence 3: in fact a cash purchase of a corporation's  stock followed by 
liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer  a claim for 
refund if the kimbell-diamond doctrine is not  applied to eliminate 
the intermediate step.
Sentence 4: 7.081106674528976 
737.
Sentence 5: as stated in seaboard and numerous other cases the two  primary 
reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the united states  code were 
to prevent the government from having to deal with more than one claimant 
and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims  on a contingent-
fee basis.
Sentence 6: 6.198766535614133 
738.
Sentence 7: the cases have allowed transfer of claims  if beneficial 
ownership is not changed.
Sentence 8:  8.988549970243525 
739.
Sentence 9: the first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer 
which meets the conditions of section  381 which is the only type 
presently under discussion.
Sentence 10: 6.84324716232423 
740.
Sentence 11: section  381 applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a 
subsidiary owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent a statutory merger 
or consolidation an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's 
assets  solely in exchange for voting stock or a change of identity 
form  or place of organization.
Sentence 12:  6.7160766240447245 
741.
Sentence 13: in virtually every case the transferor corporation is liquidated and 
its former stockholders either own outright  or have a continuing stock 
interest in the assets which gave rise to the tax.
Sentence 14: 5.623288987766043 
742.
Sentence 15: in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting
  claims is exceedingly remote.
Sentence 16:  11.398853737876168 
743.
Sentence 17: furthermore in a c reorganization the continuing interest of 
stockholders of the corporation  which paid the tax must be greater than 
is necessary in a statutory merger  to which the statute is clearly 
inapplicable.
Sentence 18:  4.922682199475459 
744.
Sentence 19: nor is it  at all likely that a desperate claim against the 
government will  be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a 
tax-free reorganization.
Sentence 20:  7.022035670826433 
745.
Sentence 21: if the transferor has substantial assets other than the  claim it 
seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all 
of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of 
taxes.
Sentence 22:  6.175078871902545 
746.
Sentence 23: if such an unlikely transaction were to take place it would more 
logically be accomplished by a stock purchase followed  by the 
prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary followed  by 
liquidation.
Sentence 24:  7.059689915203386 
747.
Sentence 25: in the rare case where a corporation's only  substantial asset or 
its most important one is a claim for refund perhaps  its transfer 
should not be permitted whether the reorganization takes the form of a 
statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets  for stock.
  6.127724970658562 
748.
Sentence 26: it appears then that although the matter is not  dealt with in 
section 381 a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type 
specified in section 381 is entitled to sue for refund  of taxes paid by 
a transferor corporation.
Sentence 27:  7.584985073860341 
749.
Sentence 28: section 203 of the united  states code has been interpreted as not 
applying to claims against  the government transferred in tax-free 
reorganizations.
Sentence 29: 5.26078977701207 
750.
Sentence 30: the successor  corporations have been held entitled to sue on 
such claims.
Sentence 31:  9.439803099895592 
751.
Sentence 32: tax attributes of the transferor  there are certain tax attributes
  of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts
  of the particular reorganization involved.
Sentence 33:  5.365079544176685 
752.
Sentence 34: for example property used  in the trade or business of a 
transferor corporation as defined in section 1231 presumably would not 
Sentence 1: retain its special status following  a non-taxable reorganization if 
it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation.
  8.056897812416711 
753.
Sentence 2: the parent of a group filing consolidated  returns might be 
treated as the same corporation following a reorganization  defined in 
section 368 but as a different corporation  for this purpose after a 
tax-free acquisition by another corporation  which had not for example 
elected to file consolidated returns  with its own subsidiaries.
  4.878634395791597 
754.
Sentence 3: similar considerations presumably made  it difficult to prescribe a 
general rule where the acquired and acquiring  corporations have 
different methods of accounting  or depreciation.
Sentence 4: 6.551339090505491 
755.
Sentence 5: other sections  of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for 
survival of certain of a transferor's tax attributes following a tax-free 
reorganization.
Sentence 6:  5.280011632582226 
756.
Sentence 7: section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis
  for property transferred and section 1223 provides for tacking on
  the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the 
transferee.
Sentence 8: 6.943969103411335 
757.
Sentence 9: section 169 permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities
  to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period.
  5.456921094434593 
758.
Sentence 10: however  a similar privilege was not specifically provided in 
section 168 for  attributes similar to a loss there may be certain items 
which are quite similar  to a net operating loss carryover or 
operating deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should 
perhaps be subject to the conditions  applicable to those items.
  5.534995139681203 
759.
Sentence 11: for example suppose another excess profits  tax similar to prior 
laws is enacted providing for carryover of  excess profits credits.
  6.7758693690835 
760.
Sentence 12: this carryover right has a number of things in  common with a net 
operating loss carryover.
Sentence 13:  9.765064975238827 
761.
Sentence 14: it is an averaging device  intended to ease the tax burden of 
fluctuating income; it is a tax  benefit which might be of substantial 
value to a corporation which expects  to have a high excess profits 
tax.
Sentence 15:  6.961470608139972 
762.
Sentence 16: under the 1939 code this item  was permitted to survive a tax-
free reorganization in the stanton  brewery case but only over the 
dissent of judge learned hand  who wrote the majority opinion in the 
sansome case a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits 
in a non-taxable reorganization.
Sentence 17:  6.032286788469066 
763.
Sentence 18: since this type of item was not in the statute when section 381 was 
enacted in 1954 one cannot say with certainty what effect  the 
enactment of that section should have.
Sentence 19: 6.080643184489887 
764.
Sentence 20: with respect to this  type of item one might properly apply the 
language of the committee  report quoted above which cautions against 
using section 381 as a basis for treating other tax attributes not 
mentioned therein.
Sentence 21:  7.234953563956535 
765.
Sentence 22: actually there do not presently appear to be items in the statute 
comparable to a net operating loss carryover.
Sentence 23:  6.965778513435225 
766.
Sentence 24: probably the primary reason  for special treatment of a net 
operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax 
avoidance.
Sentence 25: 7.5340394207877655 
767.
Sentence 26: there were two  methods that could have been used for conducting 
the study within the  resources available: interviews in depth with a 
few selected  companies and the more limited interrogation of a large 
number of  companies by means of a mail questionnaire.
Sentence 27:  8.253737241627519 
768.
Sentence 28: while the method of interviewing a small number of companies was 
appealing because of the  opportunity it might have furnished to probe 
Sentence 1: fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and 
opinions it also involved  the risk of paying undue attention to the 
unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies.
  6.424744312601869 
769.
Sentence 2: as a result it was decided that  a mail questionnaire sent to a 
large number of companies would be more effective in determining the 
general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of 
the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that 
concern both industry and government.
Sentence 3:  7.223953997092721 
770.
Sentence 4: it was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would 
suggest  fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of 
a more  detailed nature.
Sentence 5: 9.703149147297152 
771.
Sentence 6: it is recognized that a mail questionnaire  has inherent 
limitations.
Sentence 7:  15.059863694715913 
772.
Sentence 8: there is the danger that the questions will  mean different things 
to different respondents.
Sentence 9:  15.195843488785012 
773.
Sentence 10: simple yes or no answers do not reveal the different shades of 
opinion that the various respondents may have.
Sentence 11:  5.236383152695367 
774.
Sentence 12: a respondent may want to make alternative  answers because he 
does not know the precise circumstances assumed  in the question.
  10.562918354367518 
775.
Sentence 13: there is also the problem of the respondent's frame of reference.
  17.863316882716227 
776.
Sentence 14: is the respondent making a recommendation for his own  benefit for 
the benefit of his industry for the benefit of a specific  government 
department or service for the benefit of the defense  program for the 
benefit of small business or for the benefit of the  taxpayers?
  10.565841707775201 
777.
Sentence 15:    there is also the question of whether the respondent  based his 
answers on factual information and carefully considered judgment or 
whether his answers were casual guesses.
Sentence 16:  8.452075412352073 
778.
Sentence 17: finally there  is the question of how strongly an expressed 
opinion is held- whether  it is a firm opinion or one that the 
respondent favors only slightly  over the alternatives.
Sentence 18:  6.809880297573636 
779.
Sentence 19: the research team was very mindful of  these dangers and 
limitations of a mail questionnaire.
Sentence 20:  7.15388948075286 
780.
Sentence 21: under the circumstances however the team considered it would provide 
the most useful  information at this point.
Sentence 22:  8.879663939865784 
781.
Sentence 23: in the preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above 
were carefully considered and the structure  and phraseology used were 
designed to minimize the effects of these  limitations.
  6.907676503538704 
782.
Sentence 24: the questionnaire was  designed to elicit three types of 
information: the facts regarding  certain characteristics of the 
respondents including their experience with and interest in securing 
defense business; the actual selling and buying practices of the 
respondents; and the attitudes  and opinions of the respondents 
concerning bidding procedures and the methods of awarding defense 
contracts.
Sentence 25: 5.776892081063983 
783.
Sentence 26: it was hoped that the facts  concerning the characteristics and 
practices of the respondents would  offer clues to the reasons why 
they took the positions and made the  recommendations which they did.
  6.225728200058096 
784.
Sentence 27: the major sections of the questionnaire are devoted to the 
following: information for classifying respondents characteristics of 
defense sales activities  respondents' practices in participating  in 
advertised bidding for defense business respondents' practices in 
participating in negotiated bidding for defense purposes respondents' 
opinions regarding advertised bidding  respondents' opinions regarding
  negotiated bidding  respondents' preferences regarding the 
Sentence 1: methods of awarding defense contracts   the questionnaire  provided a 
place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification  of 
the respondent was optional.
Sentence 2: 6.305925741288328 
785.
Sentence 3: the questionnaire also stated  that in any event all replies 
would be treated confidentially.
Sentence 4:  7.447004472385779 
786.
Sentence 5: it is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the
  questionnaire identified themselves.
Sentence 6:  16.91153336519083 
787.
Sentence 7: the questionnaire the research team prepared and then revised the 
questionnaire  over a period of six months.
Sentence 8: 6.839756460544422 
788.
Sentence 9: in june 1960 an early draft  of the questionnaire along with a cover 
letter was mailed to fourteen  companies in the state of washington.
  9.5893335865743 
789.
Sentence 10: several days after the companies  had received the questionnaire 
members of the research team contacted the presidents of eleven of these 
companies in person or by phone  to discuss any ambiguities or 
difficulties the addressees might have experienced in completing the 
questionnaire.
Sentence 11:  5.256113899212793 
790.
Sentence 12: this test resulted in  further revisions of the questionnaire.
  11.814400607264279 
791.
Sentence 13: the research team was  concerned that responses from firms in the 
state of washington might  not be typical of those throughout the 
country or that the results might be different when no phone or personal 
follow-up was made.
Sentence 14:  5.683351152834546 
792.
Sentence 15: accordingly another test of the questionaire was made.
  9.924684914768017 
793.
Sentence 16: the revised draft was mailed in july 1960 to 100 firms throughout 
the united states.
Sentence 17:  6.427949924727989 
794.
Sentence 18: fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from 3500 
names submitted by member companies of the aerospace industries 
association and fifty were selected in a similar manner from  a list of 
1500 names compiled by the research team from the thomas register.
  6.276833382497373 
795.
Sentence 19: the method of compiling the aia and  tr lists will be described 
later.
Sentence 20:  8.457169416997049 
796.
Sentence 21: ten days after the questionnaires were mailed follow-up airmail 
postcards were sent urging  those companies which had not yet returned 
their questionnaires to do  so at once.

797.
Sentence 23: twenty-eight returns in all were received.
Sentence 24:  7.622507342753323 
798.
Sentence 25: the responses  were carefully checked for obvious errors in the 
answers or for questions  that were apparently not understood by the 
respondent.
Sentence 26: 7.373312151862096 
799.
Sentence 27: the cover  letter questionnaire and follow-up postcard were then 
revised into  final form of mailing lists the objective of the study 
was to determine the  opinions and practices of small firms selling to 
defense programs.
Sentence 28:  4.948504412373319 
800.
Sentence 29: the  firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this 
objective  in mind.
Sentence 30:  8.54612616210626 
801.
Sentence 31: three lists of companies were made and used in the study.
 6.860261309434493 
802.
Sentence 32: the first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in 
the state of washington which were personally known to  the research team 
to be active in defense work.
Sentence 33:  9.262072811263138 
803.
Sentence 34: the primary consideration  in the compilation of this list was 
convenience in discussing the  questionnaire with company officers.
  6.229494865611091 
804.
Sentence 35: the second list was derived  from a group of approximately 8000 
names supplied to the research  team by the aerospace industries 
association.
Sentence 36:  8.158622531805037 
Sentence 1: 805.
Sentence 2: these names were secured  from member companies by the 
association from the forty-four sources listed in appendix f.
  6.563557301591768 
806.
Sentence 3: each source selected from its approved  bidders list about 200 firms 
which it believed to be small businesses  that participated in the 
production of weapons and weapon support systems.
Sentence 4:  7.61028224925057 
807.

from the thomas register.
Sentence 13:  8.757421584114246 
813.
Sentence 14: it was compiled as a control sample  to determine if the opinions 
and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the 
aerospace industries association  were materially different from those of 
other small firms selling to defense  programs.
Sentence 15:  7.184200545339284 
814.
Sentence 16: such a difference might have resulted from:  the fact that the 
aerospace industries association members whose  lists were used did 
not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs.
Sentence 17:  7.26705123501818 
815.
Sentence 18: the fact that companies on the aia lists were already
  participating in the defense program because of the manner of their
  selection.
Sentence 19: 8.888080866931421 
816.
Sentence 20: accordingly as in-group they might have differe nt  opinions  and 
practices than an out-group composed of those companies not so 
participating but interested in defense business.
Sentence 21:  6.5710356015636435 
817.

opinions  and practices of small firms.
Sentence 27:  7.677450945120173 
843.
Sentence 28: the second step in processing  was to compare the responses from 
companies on the aia list with  those from companies on the tr list in

Sentence 2: by virtue of  the legal responsibilities of the department of 
employment in the  farm placement program we necessarily found 
ourselves in the middle between  these two forces.
Sentence 3:  9.394732976370623 
851.
Sentence 4: it is not a pleasant or easy position but one we have endeavored to

favoritism toward the other.
Sentence 11: 8.47193481424953 
855.
Sentence 12: we have consoled ourselves  with the thought that this is a normal 
human reaction and is one  of the consequences of any decision in an 
adversary proceeding.
Sentence 13: 8.081065687929836 
856.
Sentence 14: it  is disconcerting nevertheless to read in a labor weekly 
perluss  knuckles down to growers and then to be confronted with a 
growers'  publication which states perluss recognizes obviously phony 
and  trumped-up strikes as bona fide.
Sentence 15:  6.514631564022131 
857.
Sentence 16: for a number of years  there have been sporadic attempts in 
california to organize farm workers.
Sentence 17:  9.251525457015324 
858.
Sentence 18: these attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons.
  9.665391441256943 
859.
Sentence 19: they were inadequately financed without experienced leadership and
  lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole.
  6.749079213941157 
860.
Sentence 20: this past  year the pattern has been different: the organizing 
program had the  full support of the afl-cio which supplied staff and 
money to the awoc as well as moral support.
Sentence 21:  7.465787803596465 
861.
Sentence 22: leadership was experienced  and skillful and financial resources 
were significant.
Sentence 23:  6.460370037324521

parties failure  to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore 
the facts  of life.
Sentence 25:  6.723339753771885 
863.
Sentence 26: as a result of these changed conditions the impact of the 
organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations  has 
been much greater than in the past.

864.
Sentence 28: the awoc has been able to employ the traditional weapons of labor- 
the strike and the  picket  line- with considerable success 
particularly in the area of wages.
Sentence 29:  7.665853002647101 
865.
Sentence 30: by the very nature of the situation it is the union which  has 
been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management.
  8.058587436719753 
866.
Sentence 31: to date at least the strategy of the awoc has been selective; that 
is to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity  in a 
particular area at a strategic time rather than any broadside engagement 
with management throughout an area or the state.
Sentence 32:  7.207160569149256 
867.
Sentence 33: primarily we became involved in these disputes because of our 
referral  obligations under our farm placement program.
  5.326519577128725 
868.
Sentence 34: normally because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment 
insurance we would  not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit 
payments under the trade  dispute provision of the unemployment 
insurance code although  such a situation is quite within the realm of 
possibility.
Sentence 35:  6.100526369167851 
869.
Sentence 36: but the current  issues arose out of the wagner-peyser act 
concerning referrals  to an establishment where a labor dispute exists 
and out of public  law 78 and the migrant labor agreement if mexican 
nationals were  employed at the ranch.
Sentence 37: 5.942045425290292 
Sentence 1: 870.
Sentence 2: most of us remember and think of the wagner-peyser act in its 
historical sense as a major milestone in the development of public 
placement services.
Sentence 3:  9.285243180456082 
871.
Sentence 4: infrequently do we think  of it as a living continuing operating 
control over the system.
Sentence 5:  6.352983581404954 
872.
Sentence 6: however  when labor disputes arise its provisions come clearly 
into play.
Sentence 7: 7.879513779734377 
873.
Sentence 8: california has accepted the provisions of that act by enacting into 
our code a provision that  the state of california accepts the 
provisions of the  wagner-peyser act h and will observe and comply 
with the requirements of that act.
Sentence 9:  4.506734639447049 
874.
Sentence 10: with respect to labor disputes the wagner-peyser  act states only   
in carrying out the provisions  of this act the secretary is authorized 
and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs 
to applicants before they  are referred to employment.
Sentence 11: 6.629365664168166 
875.
Sentence 12: other provisions of the act empower  the secretary to adopt 
regulations necessary to carry out its provisions  and he has done so.
  6.049512904794806 
876.
Sentence 13: the pertinent regulation for our purposes  is section 602.
  10.582206877639416 
877.
Sentence 14: 2 as follows:   referrals in labor dispute situations.
  9.148655398712318 
878.
Sentence 15: no person shall be referred to a position the filling of which will 
aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which  is vacant because the 
former occupant is on strike or is being locked  out in the course of a 
labor dispute or the filling of which  is an issue in a labor dispute.
  6.667599842844862 
879.
Sentence 16: with respect to positions not covered  by subparagraph of this 
paragraph any individual may be  referred to a place of employment in 
which a labor dispute exists provided  he is given written notice of 
such dispute prior to or at the time  of his referral.
Sentence 17: 5.392521482661337 
880.
Sentence 18: in analyzing this regulation let us take  the last sentence 
first.
Sentence 19:  10.680886366150174 
881.
Sentence 20: it permits referrals under certain circumstances  even when there 
is a labor dispute provided the individual is  given written notice 
of such a dispute.
Sentence 21:  7.281563596698024 
882.
Sentence 22: assume for example a situation  where a farm has a packing shed 
and fields.
Sentence 23: 7.8854260369698626 
883.
Sentence 24: the packing shed workers  go on strike.
Sentence 25:  9.802060557618772 
884.
Sentence 26: there is no dispute involving fieldwork.
Sentence 27:  31.247677617749154 
885.
Sentence 28: we concluded  that we may refer workers to the fieldwork
  provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute.
  6.157602370458302 
886.
Sentence 29: so far no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision.
  12.07111099429687 
887.
Sentence 30: it is the first part of the regulation that is currently at issue.
  14.435980485479014 
888.
Sentence 31: note that it prohibits referrals under either condition  or 
condition.
Sentence 32: 9.89936252589347 
889.
Sentence 33: employer representatives have contended that the secretary  has 
gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition on the  grounds that the 
wagner-peyser act requires only written notice to  the prospective worker 
that a dispute exists.
Sentence 34: 4.5421746389230675 
890.
Sentence 35: the matter  got into the courts this way: one of the early strikes 
called  by the awoc was at the digiorgio pear orchards in yuba county.
  8.27132987741457 
891.
Sentence 36: we found that a labor dispute existed and that the workers had left
  their jobs which were then vacant because of the dispute.
  7.42388720933535 
Sentence 1: 892.
Sentence 2: accordingly under clause of the secretary's regulation we suspended
  referrals to the employer.
Sentence 3:  7.615092762846159 
893.
Sentence 4: the employer seeking to continue his harvest challenged  our right 
to cease referrals to him and sought relief in the superior  court of 
yuba county.
Sentence 5:  5.707979950475336 
894.
Sentence 6: the court issued a temporary restraining  order directing us to 
resume referrals.
Sentence 7:  10.015072012940244 
895.
Sentence 8: we of course obeyed the court  order.
Sentence 9:  10.717432709549398 
896.
Sentence 10: however the attorney general of california at the request  of 
the secretary of labor sought to have the jurisdiction over  the issue 
removed to the federal district court on grounds that  it was 
predominantly a federal issue since the validity of the secretary's
  regulation was being challenged.
Sentence 11:  8.006703027421517 
897.
Sentence 12: however the federal court  held that since the state had accepted 
the provisions of the wagner-peyser  act into its own code and 
presumably therefore also the  regulations it was now a state matter.
  5.20300760161347 
898.
Sentence 13: it accordingly refused to assume  jurisdiction whereupon the 
california superior court made the  restraining order permanent.
  9.459368085401477 
899.
Sentence 14: under that order we have continued referring  workers to the ranch.
  7.609953496595128 
900.
Sentence 15: a similar case arose at the bowers ranch  in butte county and 
the superior court of that county issued similar  restraining orders.
  7.350730863883087 
901.
Sentence 16: the growers have strenuously argued  that i should have accepted 
the superior court decisions as conclusive  and issued statewide 
instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the secretary's 
regulation.
Sentence 17: 5.037374730288671 
902.
Sentence 18: i cannot accept that view  either as a lawyer or as an 
administrator.
Sentence 19:  10.530755366033473 
903.
Sentence 20: first let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations 
involved.
Sentence 21:  8.724519088073281 
904.
Sentence 22: it is an accepted juridical principle in california that a superior
  court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent.
  10.000235435545846 
905.
Sentence 23: it  is conclusive unless appealed only upon the particular parties 
to  the particular action which was heard.
Sentence 24: 5.917806687549367 
906.
Sentence 25: it is not binding upon another  superior court which could rule 
to the contrary.
Sentence 26: 13.711587323548112 
907.
Sentence 27: only when a decision  is rendered by the district court of appeal
  is a binding precedent established.
Sentence 28:  6.173037007079485 
908.
Sentence 29: in that event  we can correctly say that we have received an 
authoritative interpretation of the matter and one which we can follow 
statewide with confidence  that the policy will not be overthrown in 
other superior courts.
Sentence 30: 7.751317274788524 
909.
Sentence 31: but over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent
  decision i am convinced that the decisions of the superior courts
  which in effect nullify the secretary's regulation are not a
  correct interpretation of the secretary's power under the federal
  law.
Sentence 32:  5.6882979937125135 
910.
Sentence 33: i believe i am in good company in this view.
Sentence 34:  12.027581026306956 
911.
Sentence 35: the attorney general  of california concurs in this interpretation 
and has filed an appeal  from these decisions to the district court of 
appeal.
Sentence 36:  5.645494733601075 
912.
Sentence 37: the attorney  general of the united states in considering the 
power of the  secretary to issue similar regulations under the wagner-
peyser act relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers has 
rendered  an opinion sustaining his authority.
Sentence 38:  8.537841045544956 
Sentence 1: 913.
Sentence 2: further and as an evidence of  legislative intent only the 
senate of the united states recently  defeated by a substantial 
majority the holland amendment to the  fair labor standards act which 
would have specifically limited  the regulatory authority of the 
secretary in these matters.
Sentence 3: 6.501144586839923 
914.
Sentence 4: next  let us consider briefly the program and administrative 
implications  of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals.
  8.389488563605939 
915.
Sentence 5: there is far  too much at stake for all of the parties concerned 
to leave the matter  hanging in midair.
Sentence 6:  10.924237391904724 
916.
Sentence 7: the ramifications of the issue are enormous.
Sentence 8:  11.387658710676023 
917.
Sentence 9: a  decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike 
would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations and might 
in  effect place the public employment services in the position of 
acting  as strikebreakers.
Sentence 10:  5.203443827008611 
918.
Sentence 11: the public interest is so dominant in such an issue that i cannot be 
so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative  order 
based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two superior 
courts in the state.
Sentence 12:  6.816983349539488 
919.
Sentence 13: it is an issue which  may well reach the supreme court of the 
united states before judicial  finality is achieved.
  14.477019976595734 
920.
Sentence 14: as an administrator i cannot place the employment service in 
california in jeopardy of being out of compliance  with the federal laws 
by my failure to pursue the avenues of appeal open to me.
  7.088470361948485 
921.
Sentence 15: to have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in 
superior court in my opinion would have placed us  clearly out of 
compliance with the wagner-peyser act and would have  immediately 
opened the way for the secretary of labor were he so  inclined to 
notify the governor of such noncompliance set a date for hearing and issue 
his finding.
Sentence 16:  5.540270385491435 
922.
Sentence 17: the impact of noncompliance under the wagner-peyser act is clear: 
the withdrawal of some $11 million  a year of administrative funds 
which finance our employment service  program or as a corollary the 
taking over by the federal government  of its operation.
  6.786623877757662 
923.
Sentence 18: thus far the cases which have come before  the courts have 
involved only the issue of referral where the job is  vacant due to a 
strike- condition in the regulation of the secretary.
Sentence 19:  4.972167907959598 
924.
Sentence 20: none has yet arisen under condition relating to referral to jobs the 
filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute.
Sentence 21:  8.234100177747301 
925.
Sentence 22: here the problem is essentially one of defining the word filling.
  9.505921215140184 
926.
Sentence 23: should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements
  as job specifications union membership union jurisdiction and the 
like? 6.783435031846547 
927.
Sentence 24:  or should it have a broader connotation of including wage
  demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the
  mechanics of filling the job.
Sentence 25:  5.261226014965208 
928.
Sentence 26: because of the uncertainty  of this definition i solicited the 
interpretation of the secretary  of labor.
Sentence 27:  12.429249586316454 
929.
Sentence 28: he has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the
  proper one; that is that if wages for example is the only issue
  in a labor dispute and no workers have left their jobs because of 
the  dispute we may continue to make referrals.
Sentence 29:  5.36872064862156 
930.
Sentence 30: martin and stendler present evidence that infants and young
  children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple 
perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them.
  6.342503627803595 
Sentence 1: 931.
Sentence 2: after they  have developed concepts they are free from the necessity 
of manipulating  objects; they do symbolically what they once had to do 
concretely.
Sentence 3: 7.426019817682833 
932.
Sentence 4: the ability to think seems to increase consistently with age.
  10.842380275899938 
933.
Sentence 5: one  experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring 
between  the eleventh and twelfth years.
Sentence 6:  5.825820622377272 
934.
Sentence 7: many studies indicate that  elementary-school children's interests 
cover the whole field of science; that their questions indicate a genuine 
interest in social processes and events; and that as they mature their 
interests and capabilities  change and broaden.
Sentence 8:  6.1052656878841915 
935.
Sentence 9: how a child feels about himself about other people and about the 
tasks confronting  him in school may have as much influence on his 
success in school  as his physical and intellectual characteristics.
  5.230707060086062 
936.
Sentence 10: a considerable amount  of evidence exists to show that an unhappy 
and insecure child is not  likely to do well in school subjects.
  7.7184905354990265 
937.
Sentence 11: emotional maturity is the result  of many factors the principal 
ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child's life.
  5.036725221053489 
938.
Sentence 12: however the teacher who understands  the influence of emotions on 
behavior may be highly influential  in helping pupils gain confidence 
security and satisfaction.
Sentence 13:  7.726515163157427 
939.
Sentence 14: concerning this responsibility of the teacher suggestions for 
helping  children gain better control of the emotions are presented in 
chapter 11.
Sentence 15:  6.5063210612718665 
940.
Sentence 16: the following generalizations about the emotional characteristics
  of elementary-school children may be helpful.
Sentence 17:  9.919242564275502 
941.
Sentence 18: typically  the young child's emotional reactions last for a 
relatively short time as contrasted to those of an adult.
  6.011680697138881 
942.
Sentence 19: as the child grows  older his emotional reactions lead to moods 
or emotional states  drawn out over a period of time and expressed 
slowly rather than in short abrupt outbursts.
Sentence 20:  9.317683042739707 
943.
Sentence 21: studies of the growth and decline of children's fears indicate that 
fears due to strange objects noises  falling and unexpected movement 
decline during the preschool years  but that fears of the dark of 
being alone and of imaginary creatures or robbers increase.
  4.538216972561754 
944.
Sentence 22: ridiculing a child for being afraid  or forcing him to meet the 
feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing  with the problem; more 
effective solutions include explanations  the example of another child 
or conditioning by associating the feared  object place or person with 
something pleasant.
Sentence 23:  5.792963746401121 
945.
Sentence 24: children  need help in learning to control their emotions.
  6.764147616291221 
946.
Sentence 25: the young child  learns from parents and teachers that temper 
tantrums screaming kicking  and hitting will not get him what he wants; 
the older child learns that intense emotional outbursts will not win 
approval by his peers and therefore makes a real effort to control his 
emotions.
Sentence 26:  6.0900286843600515 
947.
Sentence 27: children differ widely in their emotional responses.
  7.14162538120728 
948.
Sentence 28: among infants  the patterns of emotional responses are similar; 
as the influence of learning and environment are felt emotional behavior 
becomes individualized.
Sentence 29:  7.2700340562052705 
949.
Sentence 30: although no national norms exist  for the social development of 
children the teacher can find a great  deal of information concerning 
Sentence 1: types of social behavior normally displayed  by children at various age 
levels.
Sentence 2:  5.465852293767151 
950.
Sentence 3: the following summary will  give the student some idea about the 
social characteristics of elementary-school  children; the student will 
certainly want to explore more  deeply into the fascinating study of 
immature individuals struggling  to meet their developmental needs and 
at the same time trying to learn  the rules of the game in the ever-
expanding number of groups in which  they hold membership.
  7.123039924141235 
951.
Sentence 4: during early childhood children  are more interested in the 
approval of their parents and teachers than  they are in the approval of 
other children; after they have been in school a few years their interest 
in playmates of their own age increases and their interest in adults 
decreases; the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his 
parents on picnics and family  gatherings now considers it a bore.
  6.04756762603075 
952.
Sentence 5: in late childhood the influence  of the group on the social 
behavior of the child continues to increase; the group sets the styles in 
clothing the kind of play engaged in  and the ideals of right and wrong 
behavior.
Sentence 6: 0.0 
953.
Sentence 7: in early childhood  the choice of a companion is likely to be for 
another child of his  own age or a year or two older who can do the 
things he likes to do; such factors as sex intelligence and status in the 
group do not  influence his choice much at this time.
Sentence 8: 5.855979668935667 
954.
Sentence 9: in later childhood  an interest in team games replaces individual 
play; loyalty to the group  a feeling of superiority over those who are 
not members and unwillingness  to play with members of the opposite 
sex become dominant traits.
Sentence 10: 7.983996165091388 
955.
Sentence 11: during early childhood boys tease and bully on the average  more 
than girls; those who feel inferior or insecure engage in  these 
activities more than do well-adjusted children.
Sentence 12:  5.591812762439252 
956.
Sentence 13: during late childhood boys like to tease jostle and talk smart to 
girls;  girls who are more mature than boys frown upon the youthful 
antics  of boys of their own age.
Sentence 14:  6.221575167356117 
957.
Sentence 15: by the time pupils reach the sixth grade their ethical and moral 
standards are fairly well developed;  they exhibit a keen interest in 
social political and economic problems but they frequently have vague 
and incorrect notions about the  terms they use rather glibly in their 
routine school work.
Sentence 16:  5.1102616481061975 
958.
Sentence 17: between  the ages of two and four years negativism or resistance 
to adult authority is noticeable; after the fourth year it begins to 
decline.
Sentence 18:  6.257511103075432 
959.
Sentence 19: however as we have seen in later childhood the child begins to
  substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and 
teachers.
Sentence 20:  6.665619053070675 
960.
Sentence 21: the elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability  to 
work in groups.
Sentence 22:  9.005093323721033 
961.
Sentence 23: the child in the primary grades can play harmoniously  with one 
companion but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble 
when the group gets larger; he wants to be with  people but he hasn't 
yet learned to cooperate.
Sentence 24:  5.671692206617755 
962.
Sentence 25: in the middle grades  however he begins to participate more 
effectively in group activities  such as selecting a leader helping to 
make plans and carry on  group activities and setting up rules 
governing the enterprise.
Sentence 26:  7.792491002394017 
963.
Sentence 27: the teacher should study the individual pupil much progress has
  been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for 
understanding  children yet in almost any classroom today can be found 
children  whose needs are not being met by the school program.
  5.98418881596091 
Sentence 1: 964.
Sentence 2: some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit; 
others never  seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom.
  9.504098229645852 
965.
Sentence 3: these children  have been described as those who were trying to 
say something to adults  who did not understand.
Sentence 4:  6.055805157036741 
966.
Sentence 5: many school systems now employ school  psychologists and child 
guidance specialists.
Sentence 6: 9.310984932657822 
967.
Sentence 7: these specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers 
learn to identify children  who need special attention by suggesting ways 
of meeting the needs  of individual children in the regular classroom 
and by providing clinical  services for severely maladjusted children.
  5.114940505008844 
968.
Sentence 8: it is the classroom  teacher however who has daily contacts with 
pupils and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological 
principles into practice.
Sentence 9:  9.625938887065374 
969.
Sentence 10: indeed a study of the individual child is an integral part of the 
work  of the elementary-school teacher rather than merely an additional
  chore.
Sentence 11:  7.343751036392902 
970.
Sentence 12: teachers and administrators in many elementary schools  have 
assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the  basi s 
of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals.
  6.612952039089439 
971.
Sentence 13: what they should recognize is that children who have been placed
  in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ 
widely  in attributes that influence success and that they still must 
be  treated as individuals.
Sentence 14:  5.844711758112916 
972.
Sentence 15: although the teacher must be concerned with  maintaining standards 
he must also be concerned about understanding  factors that inhibit
  studies conducted in various sections of the united states indicate 
that many children in elementary  schools are maladjusted emotionally and 
that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school 
subjects.
Sentence 16:  7.864305926257026 
973.
Sentence 17: one study  which involved 1524 pupils in grades one to six found 
that 12 percent  of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 
percent were reading  a year below capacity.
Sentence 18: 5.217237238796266 
974.
Sentence 19: it is apparent therefore that the teacher  needs to know what 
factors have a vital bearing on the learning and  adjustment of 
children.
Sentence 20:  10.533288261713468 
975.
Sentence 21: when a child fails to meet the standards of  the school in his rate 
of learning insecurity unhappiness and other forms of maladjustment 
frequently follow.
Sentence 22:  6.412217595248203 
976.
Sentence 23: these maladjustments in turn inhibit learning and a vicious cycle is 
completed.
Sentence 24: 8.540901980461344 
977.
Sentence 25: it is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not 
achieving  in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy or

  4.89019406951158 
Sentence 1: 1024.
Sentence 2: knowledge  that thousands of school districts are involved and

1025.
Sentence 4: before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us

Sentence 18:  9.430036403335416

ring around a black core may come with the opening of nearby montgomery 
county  suburbs to negro residents and presumably the consequent 
conclusion of some whites that they cannot escape the negro by fleeing to
  the suburbs.
Sentence 20:  5.393095269041167 
1034.
Sentence 21: in fact short of fleeing to warrenton virginia or rockville

account of his color.
Sentence 34: 7.834138346144816 
1042.
Sentence 35: in general members of nairo would certainly want a child admitted

  8.23689773845506 
1043.
Sentence 36: how to achieve this objective is a problem but we are not divided 
on what we want.
Sentence 37: 8.146047738832012 
1044.
Sentence 38: second as  we increase the number of desegregated school districts 
and schools themselves how can we achieve this action through school 
board action?  7.150025474360661 
1045.
Sentence 39:   it may be county school board or state school board action as 
well  as that of municipal school boards.
Sentence 40:  5.491101831995351 
1046.
Sentence 41: correlatively can we reduce the  role of the district courts so 
that the action is that of the people  of the community or other school 
district and not that of the law court? 8.512051346397202 
1047.
Sentence 42:   this is a problem and i believe there is little difference of
  opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise 
and  effect a plan of desegregation.
Sentence 43:  6.20438690488103 
Sentence 1: 1048.
Sentence 2: third how can we insure a systematic  and continuing group 
relations education in the schools?  8.949204387592383 
1049.
Sentence 3:  not simply a brief program when the schools are actually 
desegregated but a continuing program that also promotes integration that 
encourages the children and teachers not to look at each other as white 
or negro  but as human beings.
Sentence 4:  5.146252086216957 
1050.
Sentence 5: again the problem is how to get it done and  in what form to offer 
the group relations education; not whether it  should be done.
  9.62410916260667 
1051.
Sentence 6: fourth in the segregated school system during  the period before 
desegregation how can we assure equal opportunity? 5.687143305087192 
1052.
Sentence 7:   in fact in the desegregated school system which may have a 
good  many schools with all-negro population how can we assure equal 
opportunity?  6.870182299201061 
1053.
Sentence 8:   this is a problem but we are not divided over its importance
  or by its existence.
Sentence 9:  7.689518665736176 
1054.
Sentence 10: fifth in the segregated school system  or in the all-negro or all-
white schools how can we encourage better  group relations or an 
improved attitude toward people who do not belong  to the group?
  6.418498781227117 
1055.
Sentence 11:  can we help children adjust to images of other  children when the 
latter are not actually present.
Sentence 12:  6.548128333577244 
1056.
Sentence 13: if we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively
  united fashion then there are twice as many issues which i judge 
sharply  issue since on the one hand school desegregation  has come in 
virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment shall we support the plan?
  7.468626253551224 
1057.
Sentence 14:  on the basis of pupil assignment criteria  judge albert bryan has 
assigned negro children to formerly white  schools in arlington and 
alexandria virginia.
Sentence 15:  7.566995301365297 
1058.
Sentence 16: shall we support pupil assignment? 12.08571470746697 
1059.
Sentence 17:  on the other hand looking at the larger picture  is it true that 
pupil assignment has effectively cut off blocked or  reduced school 
desegregation to a trickle? 7.238291033951676 
1060.
Sentence 18:  shall we therefore  oppose the plan? 10.887392182380525 
1061.
Sentence 19:  this question is an issue because it likely divides  issue no 2.
  8.243506903035994 
1062.
Sentence 20: in large cities like baltimore louisville and washington dc should 
school  desegregation be extended to all-negro and all-white schools 
by  assigning white and negro teachers respectively?  7.50900266382061 
1063.
Sentence 21:  on the one hand do we argue the supreme court decision required 
only that a child  not be denied admission to a school on account of 
his race?  7.742430282571253 
1064.
Sentence 22:  or should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to 
children of different races and that that is impossible in an all-
something-or-the-other school we must at least provide him some 
opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school namely 
to a teacher of another  race.
Sentence 23: 6.174419021617177 
1065.
Sentence 24: we can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation
  impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated
  issue no 3.
Sentence 25: 6.9024427847783665 
1066.
Sentence 26: the earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that
  resulted in desegregation.

1067.
Sentence 28: in each instance the plaintiff was a private citizen.
  11.748931559410442 
1068.
Sentence 29: in thousands of school districts indeed in the entire  state of 
mississippi no plaintiff has come forth.
Sentence 30:  8.621803017189182 
1069.
Sentence 31: and i have established that the action of municipal county or state 
school boards  or boards of education is small infinitesimally small in 
comparison with the number of districts.
Sentence 32:  6.901257031030996 
Sentence 1: 1070.

denied admission to a school a sound requirement?  9.596201387549032 
1071.
Sentence 3:   should congress authorize the attorney general to file suit to 
accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied 
entrance? 0.0 
1072.
Sentence 4:   even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the 
provision  for the attorney general to act was eliminated should we
  nevertheless  support such a clause? 6.902872009265514 
1073.
Sentence 5:  this is an issue for it divides issue no 4.
Sentence 6: 12.213840627304437 
1074.
Sentence 7: withholding of funds to  schools  that deny children on 
account of race.
Sentence 8: 8.392032887190927 
1075.
Sentence 9: which in 1957 divided even a liberal group like the american
  veterans committee.
Sentence 10:  6.92414119425721 
1076.
Sentence 11: should we support a clause in federal  school construction or 
school assistance legislation that would  deny federal funds to a 
school district that denies admission to a  child on account of his 
race? 6.477241619526408 
1077.
Sentence 12:  this is softer than earlier powell amendments  which would have 
denied funds to all segregated school districts.
Sentence 13:  7.523821884502484 
1078.
Sentence 14: there is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause
  softened though it be on the grounds that federal aid is so 
necessary  to the public schools.
Sentence 15: 10.605516123639461 
1079.
Sentence 16: the federal funds limitation enlists the support  issue no 5.
  8.276403335092047 
1080.
Sentence 17: state or county or municipality be required to furnish public 
education? 9.554555841575683 
1081.
Sentence 18:  for the  school year 1959-1960 the prince edward county board
  of supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education and
  the school board therefore could provide no public education- for 
white or negro children.
Sentence 19:  5.102165593191952 
1082.
Sentence 20: is public education in this american democracy  of such 
importance that no child should be denied public education?
  8.107627726014146 
1083.
Sentence 21:   or is this subject a matter of self-determination a matter of 
states  rights or county rights?  7.210974487494139 
1084.
Sentence 22:  if people don't want to provide public  education should they 
be forced to do so?  9.79738818399648 
1085.
Sentence 23:  even if we marshal substantial  agreement behind mandatory public 
education we likely cannot  expect that all the states will enact the 
legislation.
Sentence 24:  7.323296889232142 
1086.
Sentence 25: should the requirement which must therefore be federal in nature be 
legislated by the united states congress?  8.945938718826888 
1087.
Sentence 26:  or must it become law by amendment  of the united states 
constitution?  8.329196984053567 
1088.
Sentence 27:  we actually have two issues  issue no 6.

1089.
Sentence 29: federal  responsibility  if the above issue is settled  by 
requiring public education for all citizens issue no 6 may  be moot.
  5.236383152695367 
1090.
Sentence 30: if on the other hand it is not settled or while it is being
  debated and resolved does the federal government have a 
responsibility  in situations like that in prince edward county?

Sentence 31:  nearly  half the children still receive no education.
  7.14162538120728

1093.
Sentence 33:  should the government directly provide education for the children 
who want public education?  6.555286197930895 
1094.
Sentence 34:   the next question is whether board members favor their own 
social  classes in their roles as educational policy-makers.
  7.754381775881478 
Sentence 1: 1095.
Sentence 2: on the whole  it appears that they do not favor their own social 
classes in an explicit way.

1096.
Sentence 4: seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly
  drawn.

1097.
Sentence 6: a hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment
  of a free public junior college in a community where there already
  was a good private college which served the middle-class youth 
adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth.
  5.683552629648356 
1098.
Sentence 7: in situations  of this sort the board generally favors the 
expansion of free education.
Sentence 8: 10.719333657765663 
1099.
Sentence 9: campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve
  western cities over the period of 1931-40 and found little or  no
  relationship between certain social and economic factors and school
  board competence as judged by a panel of professional educators who
  studied the voting records on educational issues.
Sentence 10:  4.724966825105998 
1100.
Sentence 11: the few cases  of clear favoritism along social-class lines are 
as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the 
school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors 
rather than pay  increases for teachers and such issues are not issues of 
educational policy.
Sentence 12:  6.367977412875587 
1101.
Sentence 13: in general it appears that trustees and board members  attempt to 
represent the public interest in their administration of educational 
policy and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant  values of 
the society are middle-class values which are generally thought  to be 
valid for the entire society.
Sentence 14:  6.361855879047815 
1102.
Sentence 15: there have been very few cases  of explicit conflict of interest 
between the middle class and any  other class in the field of educational 
policy.
Sentence 16:  12.699315043633343 
1103.
Sentence 17: if there were more such  cases it would be easier to answer the 
question whether the policy-makers  favor their own social classes.
  9.748992772700257 
1104.
Sentence 18: there is currently a major  controversy of public education in 
which group interests and values  are heavily engaged.
  11.893664365676829 
1105.
Sentence 19: this is the issue of segregated schools in the  south.
  13.702921946106619 
1106.
Sentence 20: in this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial
  groups rather than social-class groups.
Sentence 21: 12.308892810911882 
1107.
Sentence 22: thus the white middle and  lower classes are arrayed against the 
negro middle and lower classes.
Sentence 23:  7.263647365339972 
1108.
Sentence 24: this conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white 
middle-class  people better than it suits white lower-class people.
  8.617809549820223 
1109.
Sentence 25: if this happens there may be some class conflict in the south with 
school boards  and school teachers taking the middle-class position.
  7.347898120065516 
1110.
Sentence 26: profession the members of the educational profession have  a 
major voice in the determination of educational policy their position
  being strongest in the universities.
Sentence 27:  6.89969586624074 
1111.
Sentence 28: they are mostly upper-middle-  and lower-middle-class people 
with a few in the upper class.
Sentence 29:  8.787595714730568 
1112.
Sentence 30: do they  make class-biased decisions? 18.261201714858576 
1113.
Sentence 31:    in a society dominated by middle-class  values and working in 
an institution which transmits and strengthens  these social values it 
is clear that the educational profession  must work for the values 
which are characteristic of the society.
Sentence 32:  7.154243147573318 
1114.
Sentence 33: there is no problem here.
Sentence 34:  38.54824360862788 
1115.
Sentence 35: the problem arises if it does arise when  the educator has to 
make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional 
Sentence 1: competence but which bears some relation to the social  structure.
  6.205198848764056 
1116.
Sentence 2: for instance in giving school grades or in making recommendations
  for the award of a college scholarship does he consciously  or 
unconsciously favor students of one or another social class?
  8.529381149776272 
1117.
Sentence 3:  again  in deciding on the content and method of his teaching 
does he favor  a curriculum which will make his students stronger 
competitors in the  race for higher economic status or does he favor a 
curriculum which strengthens students in other ways?  4.958642668081173 
1118.
Sentence 4:    the answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some 
extent upon the educator's  own social-class position and also upon his 
social history as well as  upon his personality and what he conceives 
his mission to be as an educator.
Sentence 5: 7.451224991241274 
1119.
Sentence 6: in a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class
  backgrounds wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to 
students  and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as
  well as on his social-class background.
Sentence 7: 5.693122519752309 
1120.
Sentence 8: one upward-mobile teacher may  be a hard taskmaster for lower-
class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills 
that will enable them to climb while  another upward-mobile teacher may 
be a very permissive person with  lower-class pupils because he knows 
their disadvantages and deprivations  at home and he hopes to encourage 
them by friendly treatment.
Sentence 9: 6.277950691907261 
1121.
Sentence 10: one social-class factor which plays a large part in educational 
policy  today is the fact that a great many school and college 
teachers are  upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-
class families.
Sentence 11:  8.12586095518219 
1122.
Sentence 12: their own experience in the social system influences their work and
  attitudes as teachers.
Sentence 13: 8.421470663586687 
1123.
Sentence 14: while this influence is a complex matter depending upon personality 
factors in the individual as well as upon his  social-class 
experience there probably are some general statements about  social-
class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair 
degree of truth.
Sentence 15: 5.929995765816837 
1124.
Sentence 16: teachers who have been upward mobile  probably see education as 
most valuable for their students if it serves  students as it has 
served them; that is they are likely to favor  a kind of education 
that has vocational-advancement value.
Sentence 17: 6.387270587124048 
1125.
Sentence 18: this does  not necessarily  mean that such teachers will favor 
vocational education  as contrasted with liberal education but they are 
likely to favor  an approach to liberal education which has a maximal 
vocational-advancement value as against a kind of pure liberal education 
that  is not designed to help people get better jobs.
Sentence 19:  5.121493868389423 
1126.
Sentence 20: there is no doubt  that higher education since world war 2 has 
moved away from  pure liberal education toward greater emphasis on 
technology and  specialization.
Sentence 21:  10.854145123463256 
1127.
Sentence 22: there are several causes for this one being rapid economic
  development with increasing numbers of middle-class positions
  requiring engineering or scientific training.
Sentence 23:  7.59824863207075 
1128.
Sentence 24: but another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar 
faculty members with their  own use of education as a means of social 
advancement.
Sentence 25:  9.483146522310149 
1129.
Sentence 26: compared  with the college and university faculty members of the 
period from 1900 to 1930 the new postwar faculty members consist of more 
children  of immigrants and more children  of urban working-class 
fathers.
Sentence 27:  5.550364805113821 
1130.
Sentence 28: their experience is quite in contrast  with that of children of 
upper- and upper-middle-class native-born  parents who are more likely 
Sentence 1: to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the 
vocational emphases in the curriculum.
Sentence 2: 5.975020594050363 
1131.
Sentence 3: public interest groups educational policies are formed by
  several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act 
in  the public interest.
Sentence 4:  5.436915451534505 
1132.
Sentence 5: legislators are one such group and state legislators  have major 
responsibility for educational legislation.
Sentence 6:  7.573678157029758 
1133.
Sentence 7: they generally  vote so as to serve their own constituency and if 
the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class 
they might be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class 
interests  in education.
Sentence 8:  5.384436755662661 
1134.
Sentence 9: however there are relatively few such political constituencies
  and as has been pointed out there is seldom a clear-cut distinction
  between the educational interests of one social class and those
  of another.
Sentence 10: 8.188238995637574 
1135.
Sentence 11: another public interest group is the commission  of laymen or 
educators which is appointed to study an educational problem  and to make 
recommendations.
Sentence 12: 5.1810199162904835 
1136.
Sentence 13: generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the 
interest of the entire society as they conceive  it.
Sentence 14:  9.294980793470286 
1137.
Sentence 15: nevertheless their conclusions and recommendations cannot
  please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or 
political  point of view.
Sentence 16:  5.540612788665263 
1138.
Sentence 17: for instance there have been two presidential  commissions on 
higher education since world war 2.
Sentence 18:  9.954621313235615 
1139.
Sentence 19: president  truman's commission on higher education tended to take a 
liberal  expansionist position while president eisenhower's committee
  on education beyond the high school was slightly more conservative.
  5.454939918723396 
1140.
Sentence 20: both commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people
  who attempted to act in the public interest.
Sentence 21: 9.482598161344603 
1141.
Sentence 22: an example of a more definite class bias is noted in proceedings 
of the commission on  the financing of higher education sponsored by the 
association of  american universities and supported by the rockefeller 
foundation and the carnegie corporation.
Sentence 23:  5.880463582323862 
1142.
Sentence 24: this commission recommended against  the use of federal 
government funds for the assistance of private universities  and against 
a broad program of government-supported scholarships.
Sentence 25:  7.63730999433199 
1143.
Sentence 26: this might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias
  but the commission published as one of its staff studies a book by
  byron s hollingshead entitled who should go to college?
  7.727089597623813 
1144.
Sentence 27:   which recommended a federal government scholarship program.
  9.917546257747134 
1145.
Sentence 28: furthermore  the commission set up the council for financial 
aid to education as a means of encouraging private business to increase 
its support of private higher education.
Sentence 29: 5.302159047362073 
1146.
Sentence 30: thus the commission acted with a sense of social responsibility 
within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government 
support to private education.
Sentence 31:  8.440386484331679 
1147.
Sentence 32: then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational 
foundations who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by
  their support or refusal to support various educational programs 
experiments and demonstrations.
Sentence 33:  5.104444336480956 
1148.
Sentence 34: these people are practically always upper-  or upper-middle-class 
persons who attempt to act in what they regard  as the interest of the 
entire society.
Sentence 35:  9.103410757568346 
1149.
Sentence 36: finally there are  the parent organizations and the laymen's 
organizations such as the  national association of parents and teachers 
and the citizens committee  on public schools.
Sentence 37:  5.213142008167744 
Sentence 1: 1150.
Sentence 2: these have an upper-middle-class leadership  and a middle-class 
membership with rare exceptions where working-class  parents are 
active in local p-ta matters.
Sentence 3:  7.102710703707135 
1151.
Sentence 4: like the  other policy-making groups these are middle class in 
their educational  attitudes and they attempt to act in the general 
public interest  as they see it.
Sentence 5:  6.439371841790622 
1152.
Sentence 6: in general it appears that educational decisions  and educational 
policies are made by people who intend to act in the  interests of the 
society as a whole.
Sentence 7:  8.1074534664535 
1153.
Sentence 8: they are predominantly middle-  and upper-class people and 
undoubtedly share the values and attitudes  of those classes.
  6.9981532216848175 
1154.
Sentence 9: they may be unaware of the existence of lower-class  values and 
consequently fail to take them into account.
Sentence 10: 11.14482350074271 
1155.
Sentence 11: but there  is very little frank and conscious espousal of the 
interests of any one  social class by the people who have the power to 
make decisions in education.
Sentence 12: 8.060959254816881 
1156.
Sentence 13: they think of themselves as trustees for the entire society  and 
try to serve the entire society.
Sentence 14:  10.117231603742042 
1157.
Sentence 15: structure through education educational policy in the united states
  has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural
  opportunity.
Sentence 16:  6.768046299083138 
1158.
Sentence 17: in so far as this goal is achieved the society becomes more  fluid 
artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced and people at the 
lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the  material
  and cultural goods of society.
Sentence 18:  7.165973639630922 
1159.
Sentence 19: on the other hand there is a counterbalancing  purpose in 
education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their 
children.
Sentence 20:  9.727633695331967 
1160.
Sentence 21: this leads to efforts at exclusiveness through private schools and 
to the maintenance of social stratification  in the schools.
  11.345119129267111 
1161.
Sentence 22: both of these purposes exist side by side without much  overt 
conflict under present conditions.
Sentence 23:  7.9972330755528285 
1162.
Sentence 24: cultural opportunity  the broad expansion of free education results
  both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the 
society  and in promoting fluidity within the social structure.
  6.441138201362311 
1163.
Sentence 25: fifty years  ago the general raising of the school-leaving age 
to sixteen was an  example of this movement.
Sentence 26:  6.002215013717486 
1164.
Sentence 27: during the past decade the program has been  carried on through 
expansion of free higher education in state universities state colleges 
and community colleges.
Sentence 28:  10.054652246647121 
1165.
Sentence 29: the reaffirmation of  american faith in the comprehensive high 
school as expressed in the  conant study is another indication of the 
liveliness of the ideal of  maximizing opportunity through the equalizing 
of educational opportunity.
Sentence 30: 5.932533542136036 
1166.
Sentence 31: the recent federal government's student-loan program is another 
step in the direction of making higher education more available  to 
lower-status youth.
Sentence 32: 8.649388165460405 
1167.
Sentence 33: it is probably more effective than the expanded  scholarship 
programs of the past decade because the scholarship programs  mainly 
aided the students with the best academic records  and these students 
tended to use the scholarship  funds to go to more expensive colleges.
  7.495286101715725 
1168.
Sentence 34: meanwhile the private colleges have increased their tuition rates 
so much that they have raised  an economic barrier which dwarfs their 
scholarship funds.
Sentence 35:  7.676127303733819 
Sentence 1: 1169.
Sentence 2: the gains  in educational opportunity during the past decade have 
taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions.
  7.02656389681376 
1170.
Sentence 3: unfortunately however and for reasons to be discussed in the
  following chapter no rate relationships can be made completely 
nondiscriminatory  as long as all or some of the rates must be set 
above marginal  costs in order to yield adequate revenues.
  7.445741734804247 
1171.
Sentence 4: and this fact may explain  some of the disagreements among the 
experts as to the more rational  formulas for the apportionment of total 
costs among different units of service.
Sentence 5: 6.2781638530718995 
1172.
Sentence 6: one such disagreement which will receive attention in  this next 
chapter concerns the question whether rates for different kinds  of 
service in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination must  be 
made directly proportional to marginal costs or whether they  should be 
based instead on differences in marginal costs.
Sentence 7:  6.502755049470885 
1173.
Sentence 8: here the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma.
  6.605795273199848 
1174.
Sentence 9: of fully distributed cost analysis  despite  an ambiguity due 
to its failure clearly to define relative costs  the above exposition 
of fully distributed costing goes about as  far as one can go toward 
expressing the basic philosophy of the practice.
Sentence 10:  6.546426555807296 
1175.
Sentence 11: for more explicit expositions one must distinguish different types
  of analyses.
Sentence 12:  7.737557619512619 
1176.
Sentence 13: by all means the most important distinction is that  between 
those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution  of 
admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental  or 
marginal costs and those other apportionments which recognize no
  difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost 
distribution.
Sentence 14:  6.095530112225769 
1177.
Sentence 15: the first or double-step type might also be called the railroad
  type because of its application to railroads by the cost section of 
the interstate commerce  commission.
Sentence 16: 6.432115827158744 
1178.
Sentence 17: the cost section distinguishes between variable costs and constant 
costs in a manner noted in the preceding  chapter.
Sentence 18:  10.24704502735875 
1179.
Sentence 19: the variable costs alone are assigned to the different units  of 
freight traffic as representing long-run out-of-pocket costs- a term with 
a meaning here not distinctly different from that of  the economist's 
long-run marginal costs.
Sentence 20:  5.0046560062954315 
1180.
Sentence 21: there remains a residue  of total costs or total revenue 
requirements which since  it is found to behave as if it were constant 
over substantial variations in traffic density is strictly unallocable on 
a cost-finding basis.
Sentence 22: 8.032408593233063 
1181.
Sentence 23: nevertheless because the cost section has felt impelled to make
  some kind of a distribution of total costs it has apportioned this 
residue  which it sometimes calls burden among the units of carload
  traffic on a basis which is concededly quite arbitrary from the 
standpoint of cost determination.
Sentence 24: 4.866873249240942 
1182.
Sentence 25: in recent  years this burden  has amounted to about one third 
of those total revenue requirements  which the carload freight 
business is supposed to be called upon to meet.
Sentence 26: 0.0 
1183.
Sentence 27: since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates 
it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the 
interstate commerce commission has estimated out- of-pocket  costs and 
apportioned residue costs.
Sentence 28:  5.73960382994971 
1184.
Sentence 29: suffice it to say that the usefulness  of the latter apportionment 
is questionable.
Sentence 30: 9.702587602609029 
1185.
Sentence 31: but in any event full credit should be given to the cost section 
for its express and  overt recognition of a vital distinction too often 
ignored in utility-cost  analyses: namely that between a cost 
Sentence 1: allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response 
to changes in rates  of output of different classes of utility service; 
and a mere cost apportionment  which somehow spreads among the classes 
and units of service  even those costs that are strictly unallocable 
from the standpoint  of specific cost determination.
Sentence 2:  4.943969441475346 
1186.
Sentence 3: we turn  now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which 
unlike the railroad  type draws no distinction between cost allocation 
and cost  apportionment: the single-step type.
Sentence 4:  6.800110163833493 
1187.
Sentence 5: it might be called the public  utility type because of the 
considerable use to which it has  been put in gas and electric utility 
rate cases.
Sentence 6: 7.829481784314367 
1188.
Sentence 7: here no attempt is  made first to determine out- of-pocket or 
marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs reasonably 
distributed residues of total  costs.
Sentence 8:  7.598128215981978 
1189.
Sentence 9: instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs
  although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be
  functions of different variables.
Sentence 10: 6.246346625347419 
1190.
Sentence 11: moreover whereas in interstate commerce  commission parlance 
variable cost means a cost deemed to  vary in direct proportion t o 
changes in rate of output in the type  of analysis now under review 
variable cost has been used more  broadly so as to cover costs which 
while a function of some one variable  are not necessarily  a linear 
function.
Sentence 12:  5.956240182645304 
1191.
Sentence 13: as already noted in an earlier  paragraph the more familiar cost 
analyses of utility enterprises or  utility systems divide the total 
costs among a number of major classes  of service such as residential 
commercial industrial power street  lighting etc.
Sentence 14:  5.149423346456481 
1192.
Sentence 15: this grand division permits many costs to be assigned in their 
entirety to some one class such as street lighting or at least to be 
excluded completely from some important class or classes.
  6.383022820802808 
1193.
Sentence 16: high-tension industrial power service for example would not  be 
charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the 
low-tension distribution lines.
Sentence 17:  5.255287088186279 
1194.
Sentence 18: but the major portions of the total  costs of a utility business 
are common or joint to all or nearly  all classes of customers; and 
these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and 
then must somehow be reapportioned among  the units of service in 
order to report unit costs than can serve  as tentative measures of 
reasonable rates.
Sentence 19:  6.172384540920799 
1195.
Sentence 20: the general basis on  which these common costs are assigned to 
differently measured units  of service will be illustrated by the 
following highly simplified problem  of an electric-utility cost 
analysis.
Sentence 21:  5.498561634147128 
1196.
Sentence 22: but before turning to this  example we must distinguish two 
subtypes of analysis both of which belong  to the single-step type 
rather than to the double-step type.
Sentence 23:  7.802811247176351 
1197.
Sentence 24: in the first subtype the analyst distributes both total operating
  costs and total annual capital costs  among the different
  classes and units of service.
Sentence 25:  7.15854186241599 
1198.
Sentence 26: here an apportionment say of $5000000  of the total costs to 
residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 
per cent as the cost of whatever capital  is deemed to have been 
devoted to the service of the residential consumers.
Sentence 27:  7.098185761692722 
1199.
Sentence 28: but in the second subtype which i take to be the one  more 
frequently applied only the operating expenses and not the cost  of 
capital or fair return are apportioned directly among the  various 
classes of service.
Sentence 29:  6.5484560153267966 
1200.
Sentence 30: to be sure the capital investments in  the plant and  equipment 
are apportioned among the different classes as are also the  gross 
Sentence 1: revenues received from the sales of the different services.
  8.327572134720933 
1201.
Sentence 2: but  any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class 
of service over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as 
a return  realized on the capital investment attributed to the same
  service.
Sentence 3: 4.900359208359081 
1202.
Sentence 4: thus during any given year if the revenues from the residential
  service are $7000000 if the operating expenses imputed  to this 
class of service come to $5000000 and if the net investment  in the 
plant and equipment deemed devoted to this  service amounts to $30000000 
the cost analyst will report that residential  service in the 
aggregate has yielded a return of $2000000  or 6-23 per cent.
  5.732363833492211 
1203.
Sentence 5: other services will show different rates of return some probably 
much lower and some higher.
Sentence 6: 5.932668809030131 
1204.
Sentence 7: there are obvious  reasons of convenience for this practice of 
excluding cost of capital  from the direct apportionment of annual costs 
among the different  classes of service- notably the avoidance of the 
controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute 
cost of capital  or fair rate of return.
Sentence 8:  6.482706657363348 
1205.
Sentence 9: but the practice is likely to be misleading since it may seem to 
support a conclusion that as long as the revenues from any class of 
service cover the imputed operating  expenses plus some return on 
capital investment however low the  rates of charge for this service 
are compensatory.
Sentence 10:  5.4897241803631935 
1206.
Sentence 11: needless to say any  such inference would be quite unwarranted.
  9.765079463883898 
1207.
Sentence 12: for the reason just  suggested i shall assume the use of the first 
subtype of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following 
simplified example.
Sentence 13:  8.019190568547684 
1208.
Sentence 14: that is to say an allowance for cost of capital will be assumed to
  be included directly in the cost apportionment.
Sentence 15:  7.872567421239768 
1209.
Sentence 16: of the costs of an electric utility business in order to simplify
  the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis let us
  assume the application of the analysis to an electric utilit y 
company  supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-
generation plant.
Sentence 17:  5.602163009530796 
1210.
Sentence 18: let us also assume the existence of only one class or type  of 
service all of which is supplied at the same voltage phase etc  to 
residential commercial and industrial customers.
Sentence 19:  9.420640188772014 
1211.
Sentence 20: this latter  assumption will permit us to center attention on 
the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis- the 
distinction among  costs that are functions of outputs of the same 
service measured along different dimensions.
Sentence 21: 5.262086440614487 
1212.
Sentence 22: since the company under review is supplying  what we are here 
regarding as only one kind of service we might  suppose that the 
problem of total cost apportionment would be very  simple; indeed that it 
would be limited to a finding of the total annual  operating and capital 
costs of the business followed by a calculation  of this total in terms 
of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption.
Sentence 23:  7.161203170768335 
1213.
Sentence 24: in fact however the problem is not so simple.
  15.219523859943813 
1214.
Sentence 25: for a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact 
that many of these  costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output 
of  energy.
Sentence 26:  9.928002026307343 
1215.
Sentence 27: a recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required.
  8.152205351147632 
1216.
Sentence 28: the simplest division and the one most frequently used  in gas and 
electric rate cases is a threefold division  of the total operating and 
Sentence 1: capital costs into customer costs energy or volumetric costs and demand 
or capacity costs.
Sentence 2:  6.29138468634276 
1217.
Sentence 3: if this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart
  in the actual rates of charge for service as it actually does have 
in some rates there would result a three-part rate for any one  class 
of service.
Sentence 4: 5.163121678757553 
1218.
Sentence 5: for example the monthly bill of a residential  consumer might be 
the sum of a $1 customer charge a $5 charge for 250  kilowatt-hours of 
energy at 2 per kilowatt-hour and a $2 charge for  a maximum demand of 2 
kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1 per kilowatt- a total bill 
of $8 for that month.
Sentence 6: 6.991417721034758 
1219.
Sentence 7: but our present interest  lies in the measurement of costs of 
service and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to 
cover these costs.
Sentence 8:  6.626742685067913 
1220.
Sentence 9: let  us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn 
recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for 
illustrative 1.
Sentence 10:  7.6901410232041085 
1221.
Sentence 11: the  these are those operating and capital costs found to  vary 
with number of customers regardless or almost regardless of power
  consumption.
Sentence 12:  5.083242045036259 
1222.
Sentence 13: included as a minimum are the costs of metering and  billing 
along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in  taking on 
another consumer.
Sentence 14:  6.696093201836714 
1223.
Sentence 15: these minimum costs may come to $1 per month more or less for 
residential and small commercial customers although  they are 
substantially higher for large industrial users who require  more costly 
connections and metering devices.
Sentence 16: 4.7645920265937844 
1224.
Sentence 17: while costs on this  order are sometimes separately charged for in 
residential and commercial  rates in the form of a mere service charge 
they are more  frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge 
which entitles  the consumer to a very small amount of gas or 
electricity with no further payment.
Sentence 18:  6.726592819681311 
1225.
Sentence 19: but the really controversial aspect of customer-cost  imputation 
arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice  of including not 
just those costs that can be definitely earmarked  as incurred for the 
benefit of specific customers but also a substantial  fraction of the 
annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary  distribution 
system- a fraction equal to the estimated  annual costs of a 
hypothetical system of minimum capacity.
Sentence 20:  5.469290066905308 
1226.
Sentence 21: the preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined
  by the sociologist.
Sentence 22:  9.430036403335416 
1227.
Sentence 23: like primitive numbers in mathematics the entire  axiological 
framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth.
Sentence 24:  5.898636882953763 
1228.
Sentence 25: but what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically 
reproduces the idea of physical models? 10.543828561426215 
1229.
Sentence 26:  is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning 
can be assigned to the most sacred  canons in social science?
  8.43492871995475 
1230.
Sentence 27:  it has become painfully clear that the  very attempt to make 
the language of social research free of values by  erecting mathematical 
and physical models is itself a conditioned response  to a world which 
pays a premium price for technological manipulation.
Sentence 28:  7.847253396487836 
1231.
Sentence 29: this push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the
  measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has 
led  sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word mass to
  mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of 
individuals in such a group can be studied.
Sentence 30:  5.859074110365147 
1232.
Sentence 31: here i think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent.
  14.688678557602351 
Sentence 1: 1233.
Sentence 2: the simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs
  to be questioned.
Sentence 3:  8.157035641407274 
1234.
Sentence 4: for if the small group notion involves the implicit  claim that 
the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic  or 
subatomic proportions the philosopher needs to know the extent to  which 
such entities are valid.
Sentence 5:  7.016367880833384 
1235.
Sentence 6: the mere exploration of the unconscious  ground of present-day 
sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical  and logical 
investigation.
Sentence 7:  6.1911212416779 
1236.
Sentence 8: a parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation
  between perceptions experientially received and conceptions 
logically  formed.
Sentence 9:  9.575372008066365 
1237.
Sentence 10: philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection
  of socially viable categories.
Sentence 11:  6.367407910234083 
1238.
Sentence 12: this involves a sifting of the  empirical and rational elements 
entering into each social science statement.
Sentence 13: 7.994071539716753 
1239.
Sentence 14: merton's functional sociology may have great practical use in the 
study of different cultures yet it is perfectly clear as nagel  and 
hempel indicate that the concept  of function in sociology has been built 
up from physiological and biological  models in which the notions of 
teleology ie metaphysical  purpose are central.
Sentence 15:  4.715509317355069 
1240.
Sentence 16: functionalism as a sociological credo is therefore not a direct 
consequence of observations but rather an indirect consequence of 
philosophical inference  and judgment.
Sentence 17:  6.365727389270327 
1241.
Sentence 18: the purpose of this sort of philosophical study  of sociology is 
not to tyrannize but to clarify the principles of social science.
  9.402195775359038 
1242.
Sentence 19: it is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise  to 
sociology since the former is a logical rational discipline  where 
sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical.
Sentence 20:  8.018844848075974 
1243.
Sentence 21: such a position entails the negation of philosophy in its platonic 
form as something  soaring above and embracing the empirical and 
mathematical sciences.
Sentence 22: 5.7929353629881115 
1244.
Sentence 23: but contrary to whitehead philosophy is not a synonym for plato.
  11.404277255950271 
1245.
Sentence 24: the uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to
  any approach that does not descend to pure sensationalism.
  6.102898869250824 
1246.
Sentence 25: however  when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences to 
dictate the conditions of empirical research  it becomes formal 
metaphysics; shaping  the contours of life to fit the needs of legends.
  6.696397702691348 
1247.
Sentence 26: the notion of philosophy  as queen bee may fit well with 
authoritarian modes of political  ideology but it has been noted that the 
price of such an imperial  notion of philosophy is the frustration and 
flagellation of the social  sciences.
Sentence 27:  6.095514496605017 
1248.
Sentence 28: metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with  nature as it was 
in antiquity.
Sentence 29:  11.157379083582882 
1249.
Sentence 30: it has surrendered any claims of description in favor of 
psychological accounts of nothingness as in heidegger's system.
  8.021836531942338 
1250.
Sentence 31: science is mocked for wishing to know nothing  of nothing in a 
last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense  of me n.
  7.804761911388139 
1251.
Sentence 32: it is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality
  by distinguishing between description and prescription.
  9.660710924929665 
1252.
Sentence 33: it is simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has 
fallen during this century.
Sentence 34:  10.49146609895339 
Sentence 1: 1253.
Sentence 2: consider the traditional four fields  of philosophy: logic ethics 
epistemology and esthetics.
Sentence 3: 7.261543109985577 
1254.
Sentence 4: it is a  commonplace that to the degree these special preserves 
of past philosophic  hunting grounds establish an empirical content and 
suitable methodological  criteria they move away from philosophy as 
such.
Sentence 5: 8.06188135958303 
1255.
Sentence 6: what is left  to traditional systems of philosophy is in effect 
only the history of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough 
to abide by the canons of scientific method.
Sentence 7:  5.654245249855714 
1256.
Sentence 8: in this situation philosophy has survived  by separating itself 
from metaphysics by showing the ultimate  questions to be the 
meaningless questions.
Sentence 9: 9.743056835887879 
1257.
Sentence 10: the relinquishing  by philosophy of pretentious claims to 
empirical priority gives it an  ability to treat problems of meaning 
and truth which in the past it was  unable to examine because of its 
missionary attitude to knowledge of  more humble sorts.
  5.513643653089337 
1258.
Sentence 11: in the new situation philosophy is able to provide the social 
sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical 
sciences a reservoir of logical relations that can be used  in framing 
hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value.
Sentence 12:  7.947251282487832 
1259.
Sentence 13: beyond  this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by 
asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of 
social inquiry  but within its potential domain of relevance.
  4.656645272807095 
1260.
Sentence 14: in this connection  it might be noted that the theory of games 
was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science 
were exploited.
Sentence 15:  9.543527831997404 
1261.
Sentence 16: likewise  kant formulated the nebular hypothesis according to 
which the solar  system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent 
gas nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by 
laplace  in his systeme du monde.
Sentence 17:  4.682905547111112 
1262.
Sentence 18: this does not mean that philosophy resolves  the problems it 
generates any more so than riemann's geometry  settled the physical 
status of the space-time continuum.
Sentence 19:  11.027680812644316 
1263.
Sentence 20: but the forceful presentation of new issues for the sciences to 
work on is itself  a monumental task.
Sentence 21:  8.038703595484005 
1264.
Sentence 22: to those raised on marcel's homo viator  and heidegger's das 
nichtige this may seem a modest  role for philosophy.
Sentence 23:  7.833253706904074 
1265.
Sentence 24: however modesty and triviality are different qualities.
  8.921104766067472 
1266.
Sentence 25: philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear
  as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences 
evolve.
Sentence 26:  6.626280802859932 
1267.
Sentence 27: the ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind
  has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a
  more durable sort of drama.
Sentence 28: 5.584198977541488 
1268.
Sentence 29: by clarifying fundamental premises in the  social sciences and 
defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands  of each new 
scientific discipline philosophy can offer the  sort of distinction 
that can accelerate growth in human understanding.
Sentence 30: 6.046793257967282 
1269.
Sentence 31: philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful
  and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a 
hypothesis or theory is framed.
Sentence 32:  5.0091594061022 
1270.
Sentence 33: the dissection of scientific theory the examination  of a theory 
from the vantage-points of language epistemology  and ethics is itself a 
distinct contribution to knowledge no less  so because of its removal 
from empirical research.
Sentence 34:  6.604928934093401 
Sentence 1: 1271.
Sentence 2: the realm  of science whatever the degree of precision in 
formulations covers  the range of prediction and explanation.
  6.629853932146729 
1272.
Sentence 3: whatever philosophy is conceived to be its rationalist  logistic 
attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is  something other 
than science.
Sentence 4:  7.196029026127741 
1273.
Sentence 5: for some forms of philosophy this very division between the 
empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the  metaphysical 
superiority of the latter.
Sentence 6:  6.312604101438946 
1274.
Sentence 7: bergson and leroy announce  that the secret is the center of a 
philosophy and thereafter a hundred followers declare secrecy a higher 
verity.
Sentence 8:  8.154860344546112 
1275.
Sentence 9: this is simply a confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to 
look virtuous.
Sentence 10:  8.971206041118126 
1276.
Sentence 11: for  as merleau-ponty indicated it is not the secret which is 
important  but the removal of secrecy.
Sentence 12: 9.416504865346 
1277.
Sentence 13: in this philosophy and science  share a common goal.
  11.289188492680237 
1278.
Sentence 14: the hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees  that 
the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall  not be 
overcome by even the most persuasive argument; for this division is but 
an abstract representation of the social struggle between  mysticism 
and science.
Sentence 15:  6.5515977130091265 
1279.
Sentence 16: the mystification of metaphysical systems  does not imply the 
demise of philosophy only the close of a philosophic  age which 
demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical.
Sentence 17:  6.1336004932451464 
1280.
Sentence 18: the  tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize 
private  intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between 
scientific and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present 
conflict  over the limits and purpose of science religion and ideology.
  6.298762235740595 
1281.
Sentence 19: scientific systems and this includes even  the relation of 
mechanist to relativist physics are built upon refined  and corrected.
  5.236383152695367 
1282.
Sentence 20: philosophic systems by the very nature of their completeness are 
overthrown by rival systems.
Sentence 21: 7.198778874655976 
1283.
Sentence 22: in addition to the incompleteness of science and the completeness 
of metaphysics they differ  in that science is essentially descriptive 
while philosophy in its inherited forms tends to be goal-oriented 
teleological and prescriptive.
Sentence 23:  6.959931780696591 
1284.
Sentence 24: the threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour is not subject
  to objective analysis has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely 
against  the sociology of knowledge since it is precisely the job of 
the  sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less 
viable  than social behaviour.
Sentence 25: 6.570956485993961 
1285.
Sentence 26: when dealing with the actual relation  of philosophy to the 
sociology of knowledge or better the role of philosophy in assisting 
research on the social sources of ideas one has  to become necessarily 
selective.
Sentence 27: 5.768583696158625 
1286.
Sentence 28: certain features we have touched upon: philosophy as a logical 
deductive system from which a social science methodology can be built up; 
philosophic analysis of the assumptions and presumptions of the social 
sciences; and philosophy as a  guide to possible integration of 
supposedly disparate sociological investigations.
Sentence 29:  6.290778560527093 
1287.
Sentence 30: the objection will be raised that the most important  role of 
philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted  namely the 
status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in  the social 
sciences.
Sentence 31:  5.768460878890224 
Sentence 1: 1288.
Sentence 2: specifically it will be asked whether the real  questions people 
ask are not the ultimate questions that social science finds itself 
impotent in the face of.
Sentence 3:  8.066707171169428 
1289.
Sentence 4: what then is the status of such questions as: is society the ground 
of human existence  or a means to an individual goal? 6.203584787227825 
1290.
Sentence 5:  do societies develop according  to cosmic patterns or are they 
subject only to the free choice of individuals?  9.82027051272064 
1291.
Sentence 6:   does society really exist as an entity over and above the
  agglomeration of men? 5.916704755177494 
1292.
Sentence 7:  i think it must be said that contrary to metaphysical  insistence 
these are questions so framed as to defy either  empirical exploration 
or rational solutions.
Sentence 8: 11.19925791115224 
1293.
Sentence 9: as simmel and dilthey indicated questions of whether the value of 
life is individual  or social are not questions but assertions of 
faith made to  appear as legitimate questions.
Sentence 10:  5.8119128086058645 
1294.
Sentence 11: such pseudo-questions assume that answers  of concrete 
significance can be supplied to statements involving  undefined 
universals.
Sentence 12: 8.18406868512247 
1295.
Sentence 13: social theory has no more right to expect results from meaningless 
questions than physics has the right to expect a  theological solution 
to the wave-particle controversy.
Sentence 14: 5.888960893337554 
1296.
Sentence 15: it is not  that such questions are not asked.
  17.744974402673652 
1297.
Sentence 16: it is rather that introducing them  into social analysis 
reflects not so much a search for truth as for  certainty.
  9.285833073983893 
1298.
Sentence 17: an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract
  certainty since it is certainty which every new discovery in 
science  either replaces or reshapes.
Sentence 18: 7.331893982877648 
1299.
Sentence 19: to raise the added objection that men require certainty on 
psychological grounds answers to ultimate questions  having an 
irrational rather than scientific basis is in a real  sense to 
undermine the objection itself.
Sentence 20:  5.498075971750319 
1300.
Sentence 21: for what concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely that 
which can be captured for the rational ie for the scientific 
determination of what in past ages  was considered ultimate and 
irrational.
Sentence 22: 7.095486907174545 
1301.
Sentence 23: a philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an 
ultimate way reveals its acquiescence  in the shortcomings of men an 
impatience with partial tentative solutions.
Sentence 24: 5.23666488506328 
1302.
Sentence 25: men have always lived in a tentative world and in suspension  of 
ultimate judgments where and when necessary.
Sentence 26: 7.2569122533878225 
1303.
Sentence 27: uncertainty  overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest 
for new and more precise  information about the world.
Sentence 28: 5.326519577128725 
1304.
Sentence 29: without such uncertainty we are left  with a set of dogmas and 
myths.
Sentence 30:  8.400219018728693 
1305.
Sentence 31: the functional interplay of philosophy and science should as a 
minimum guarantee a meaningful option to  myth-making.
  6.196120048044738 
1306.
Sentence 32: a degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition for the growth of 
science.
Sentence 33:  10.813708723159403 
1307.
Sentence 34: but neither was the statement empirical for goodness was not a 
quality  like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard.
  7.1836338993191795 
1308.
Sentence 35: what were they to  do then with these awkward judgments of 
value?  9.692079389089505 
1309.
Sentence 36:  to find a place for  them in their theory of knowledge would 
require them to revise the  theory radically and yet that theory was what 
they regarded as their most important discovery.
Sentence 37:  5.726373782489891 
Sentence 1: 1310.
Sentence 2: it appeared that the theory could be saved  in one way only.
  11.258873390551564 
1311.
Sentence 3: if it could be shown that judgments of good and bad  were not 
judgments at all that they asserted nothing true or false but merely 
expressed emotions like hurrah or fiddlesticks  then these wayward 
judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads  could be at rest.
  5.404611986844873 
1312.
Sentence 4: this is the course the positivists took.
Sentence 5:  20.334890541159552 
1313.
Sentence 6: they explained value judgments by explaining them away.
  7.14162538120728 
1314.
Sentence 7: now i do not  think their view will do.
Sentence 8:  10.368578803405029 
1315.
Sentence 9: but before discussing it i should like to record one vote of thanks 
to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case.
  6.22393678386507 
1316.
Sentence 10: it has been said of john stuart mill that  he wrote so clearly 
that he could be found out.
Sentence 11: 12.51688530636644 
1317.
Sentence 12: this theory has been  put so clearly and precisely that it deserves 
criticism of the same kind  and this i will do my best to supply.
  6.096872517459443 
1318.
Sentence 13: the theory claims to show  by analysis that when we say that is 
good we do not mean to assert  a character of the subject of which we 
are thinking.
Sentence 14:  11.240501213712339 
1319.
Sentence 15: i shall argue  that we do mean to do just that.
Sentence 16:  8.923546411515362 
1320.
Sentence 17: let us work through an example  and the simpler and commoner the 
better.
Sentence 18:  10.125374979086894 
1321.
Sentence 19: there is perhaps no value  statement on which people would more 
universally agree than the statement  that intense pain is bad.
  8.033060748645113 
1322.
Sentence 20: let us take a set of circumstances  in which i happen to be 
interested on the legislative side and in which  i think every one of 
us might naturally make such a statement.
Sentence 21:  8.000885227806465 
1323.
Sentence 22: we  come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal 
traps in  common use.
Sentence 23: 8.116833964093411 
1324.
Sentence 24: there are signs that it has struggled for days to escape  and 
that in a frenzy of hunger pain and fear it has all but eaten off its own 
leg.
Sentence 25:  9.234232032382986 
1325.
Sentence 26: the attempt failed: the animal is now dead.
Sentence 27:  8.341215694113531 
1326.
Sentence 28: as we think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered 
we are  very  likely to say: it was a bad thing that the little animal 
should  suffer so.
Sentence 29: 8.510625837032896 
1327.
Sentence 30: the positivist tells us that when we say this we are  only 
expressing our present emotion.
Sentence 31:  7.4411082812347225 
1328.
Sentence 32: i hold on the contrary that we  mean to assert something of the 
pain itself namely that it was bad-  bad when and as it occurred.
  10.211940025399086 
1329.
Sentence 33: consider what follows from the  positivist view.
  12.161668309955505 
1330.
Sentence 34: on that view nothing good or bad happened in the case  until i 
came on the scene and made my remark.
Sentence 35:  10.35351239423101 
1331.
Sentence 36: for what i express  in my remark is something going on in me at 
the time and that of course did not exist until i did come on the scene.
  6.877796607418832 
1332.
Sentence 37: the pain of the rabbit was not itself bad; nothing evil was 
happening when that pain was being endured; badness in the only sense in 
which it is involved  at all waited for its appearance till i came and 
looked and felt.
Sentence 38: 7.0471158366080555 
1333.
Sentence 39: now  that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows.
  5.968604654030783 
1334.
Sentence 40: let  us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the 
scene and that the rabbit never was discovered.
Sentence 41:  7.126191845416098 
Sentence 1: 1335.
Sentence 2: are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in 
the sense in which we said it did?  8.515448268364052 
1336.
Sentence 3:   clearly not.
Sentence 4:  15.594944937291627 
1337.
Sentence 5: indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident  of our 
later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness  of the 
animal's pain that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance 
passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel  repugnance or 
not.
Sentence 6:  5.46007231885016 
1338.
Sentence 7: if so then it is clear that in saying the suffering  was bad we 
are not expressing our feelings only.
Sentence 8:  13.212564759804785 
1339.
Sentence 9: we are saying that  the pain was bad when and as it occurred and 
before anyone took an attitude toward it.
Sentence 10:  7.219688575065933 
1340.
Sentence 11: the first argument is thus an ideal experiment  in which we use 
the method of difference.
Sentence 12:  11.048057435051081 
1341.
Sentence 13: it removes our present expression and shows that the badness we 
meant would not be affected by this whereas on positivist grounds it 
should be.
Sentence 14: 6.281944763543696 
1342.
Sentence 15: the second argument  applies the method in the reverse way.
  11.169842010263045 
1343.
Sentence 16: it ideally removes the past event and shows that this would render 
false what we mean to say  whereas on positivist grounds it should not.
  6.285690082683112 
1344.
Sentence 17: let us suppose that the  animal did not in fact fall into the 
trap and did not suffer at all but  that we mistakenly believe it did 
and say as before that its suffering  was an evil thing.
  7.158910930266926 
1345.
Sentence 18: on the positivist theory everything i sought to express by calling 
it evil in the first case is still present in  the second.
  6.924455521964547 
1346.
Sentence 19: in the only sense in which badness is involved at all whatever
  was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety since
  all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling and that
  feeling is still there.
Sentence 20:  7.490734055108306 
1347.
Sentence 21: and our question is is such an implication  consistent with what 
we meant?  7.343441585467238 
1348.
Sentence 22:  clearly it is not.
Sentence 23:  11.928189820845404 
1349.
Sentence 24: if anyone asked us after we made the remark that the suffering was 
a bad thing whether  we should think it relevant to what we said to 
learn that the incident  had never occurred and no pain had been 
suffered at all we should  say that it made all the difference in the 
world that what we were  asserting to be bad was precisely the 
suffering we thought had occurred back there that if this had not 
occurred there was nothing left to  be bad and that our assertion was 
in that case mistaken.
Sentence 25: 4.971295212623237 
1350.
Sentence 26: the suggestion  that in saying something evil had occurred we were 
after all making no mistake because we had never meant anyhow to say 
anything about  the past suffering seems to me merely frivolous.
 6.828284528631298 
1351.
Sentence 27: if we did not mean  to say this why should we be so relieved on 
finding that the suffering  had not occurred?  7.508544814856821 
1352.
Sentence 28:  on the theory before us such relief would be  groundless for in 
that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all and hence in its 
nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved  about.
  7.80343428303392 
1353.
Sentence 29: the positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond 
recognition.
Sentence 30:  7.43304005989246 
1354.
Sentence 31: so far as i can see there is only one way out for the positivist.
  20.27256580798165 
1355.
Sentence 32: he holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of  approval or 
disapproval.
Sentence 33:  7.233226891479716 
Sentence 1: 1356.
Sentence 2: and there is a way in which he might hold  that badness did in 
this case precede our own feeling of disapproval  without belonging to 
the pain itself.
Sentence 3: 12.120643333138174 
1357.
Sentence 4: the pain in itself was neutral;  but unfortunately the rabbit on 
no grounds at all took up toward  this neutral object an attitude of 
disapproval and that made it for the  first time and in the only 
intelligible sense bad.
Sentence 5:  5.548704733651973 
1358.
Sentence 6: this way of escape  is theoretically possible but since it has 
grave difficulties of its own and has not so far as i know been urged by 
positivists it  is perhaps best not to spend time over it.
  7.425670445247468 
1359.
Sentence 7: i come now to a third argument which again is very simple.
  7.656668534210395 
1360.
Sentence 8: when we come upon the rabbit  and make our remark about its 
suffering being a bad thing we presumably  make it with some feeling; 
the positivists are plainly right in  saying that such remarks do 
usually express feeling.
Sentence 9:  6.613184097134126 
1361.
Sentence 10: but suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought 
and make our statement again.
Sentence 11:  6.478669021782826 
1362.
Sentence 12: and suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that  the 
feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded.
  8.962202089763148 
1363.
Sentence 13: the pathetic evidence is no longer before us; and we are now  so
  fatigued in body and mind that feeling is as we say quite dead.
  5.747772081675206 
1364.
Sentence 14: in  these circumstances since what was expressed by the remark 
when first made is on the theory before us simply absent the remark now 
expresses  nothing.
Sentence 15:  6.943964466192859 
1365.
Sentence 16: it is as empty as the word hurrah would be when  there was no 
enthusiasm behind it.
Sentence 17: 10.120428910697212 
1366.
Sentence 18: and this seems to me untrue.
Sentence 19:  29.352099229253493 
1367.
Sentence 20: when we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing the 
feeling  with which we made it last week may be at or near the 
vanishing point  but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did 
before we  should certainly answer yes.
Sentence 21: 4.710835872769226 
1368.
Sentence 22: we should say that we made our point  with feeling the first time 
and little or no feeling the second time  but that it was the same 
point we were making.
Sentence 23: 9.5077435902551 
1369.
Sentence 24: and if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same while 
the feeling varies from  intensity to near zero it is not the feeling 
that we primarily meant  to express.
Sentence 25: 7.537574229451851 
1370.
Sentence 26: i come now to a fourth consideration.
Sentence 27:  12.626880398769476 
1371.
Sentence 28: we all believe  that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one 
attitude is fitting  and another not; but on the theory before us such 
a belief would  not make sense.
Sentence 29:  5.544510884606459 
1372.
Sentence 30: broad and ross have lately contended that this fitness  is one of 
the main facts of ethics and i suspect they are right.
Sentence 31:  7.627130553067126 
1373.
Sentence 32: but that is not exactly my point.
Sentence 33: 20.04813221899233 
1374.
Sentence 34: my point is this: whether there  is such fitness or not we all 
assume that there is and if we do we  express in moral judgments more 
than the subjectivists say we do.
Sentence 35: 8.788314684896072 
1375.
Sentence 36: in his novel the house of the dead dostoevsky  tells of his 
experiences in a siberian prison camp.
Sentence 37: 8.410915942656272 
1376.
Sentence 38: whatever  the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today 
dostoevsky's companions  were about as grim a lot as can be imagined.
  6.603224694913559 
1377.
Sentence 39: i have heard  stories he writes of the most terrible the most 
unnatural actions  of the most monstrous murders told with the most 
spontaneous childishly merry laughter.
Sentence 40:  6.989398233852944 
Sentence 1: 1378.
Sentence 2: most of us would say that in this delight  at the killing of 
others or the causing of suffering there is something  very unfitting.
  9.526923153426633 
1379.
Sentence 3: if we were asked why we thought so we should say  that these things 
involve great evil and are wrong and that to take  delight in what is 
evil or wrong is plainly unfitting.
Sentence 4:  5.6539799967742805 
1380.
Sentence 5: now on the subjectivist  view this answer is ruled out.
  11.441776346785817 
1381.
Sentence 6: for before someone takes  up an attitude toward death suffering 
or their infliction they have  no moral quality at all.
  5.929729974125496 
1382.
Sentence 7: there is therefore nothing about them to which  an attitude of 
approval or condemnation could be fitting.
Sentence 8:  11.072749685673482 
1383.
Sentence 9: they are  in themselves neutral and so far as they get a moral 
quality they  get it only through being invested with it by the 
attitude of the onlooker.
Sentence 10:  7.375647301228128 
1384.
Sentence 11: but if that is true why is any attitude more fitting than any
  other?  11.22895877731358 
1385.
Sentence 12:  would applause for example be fitting if apart from the
  applause there were nothing good to applaud? 6.062397058960812 
1386.
Sentence 13:  would condemnation be fitting if independently of the condemnation 
there were nothing bad to condemn? 8.382575625068137 
1387.
Sentence 14:  in such a case any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting  as 
any other which means that the notion of fitness has lost  all point.
  6.898755097497204 
1388.
Sentence 15: indeed we are forced to go much farther.
Sentence 16:  12.270278937355695 
1389.
Sentence 17: if goodness  and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are 
brought into being  by them those men who greeted death and misery 
with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line.
  5.314000119439451 
1390.
Sentence 18: if there is nothing evil  in these things if they get their moral 
complexion only from our feeling  about them why shouldn't they be 
greeted with a cheer? 9.706282980517644 
1391.
Sentence 19:  to greet  them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral 
into something  bad; it would needlessly bring badness into the world; 
and even  on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright.
  5.40205426092399 
1392.
Sentence 20: on the  other hand to greet them with delight would convert what 
before was neutral  into something good; it would bring goodness into 
the world.
Sentence 21: 7.753978209307249 
1393.
Sentence 22: the injured german veteran was a former miner twenty-four years
  old who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head.
  8.055176010039647 
1394.
Sentence 23: this resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to 
the left  side of the cerebellum also.
Sentence 24: 7.286428797910562 
1395.
Sentence 25: in any event the extraordinary result  of this injury was that he 
became psychically blind while at the same time apparently the sense of 
touch remained essentially intact.
Sentence 26:  8.238266674411097 
1396.
Sentence 27: psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total 
absence  of visual memory-images a condition in which for example one
  is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a 
memory-picture  of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his 
absence.
Sentence 28:  6.5405366399743325 
1397.
Sentence 29: this circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his 
tactual  capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes 
its  exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence 
presented  by the authors is overwhelming that when the patient closed 
his eyes  he had absolutely no spatial awareness whatsoever.
  5.153347577022151 
Sentence 1: 1398.
Sentence 2: the necessary inference as the authors themselves interpret  it 
would seem to be this:  spatial qualities are not among those grasped by 
the sense of touch as such.
Sentence 3: 8.198056813487872 
1399.
Sentence 4: we do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch 
by itself.
Sentence 5: 11.570436899743278 
1400.
Sentence 6: spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of 
visual  representations; that is there is in the true sense only a 
visual  space.
Sentence 7:  8.166566807153272 
1401.
Sentence 8: the underlying assumption of course is that only  sight and touch 
enable us in any precise and fully dependable way to  locate objects in 
space beyond us the other senses being decidedly inferior  if not 
totally inadequate in this regard.
Sentence 9:  4.958391598343503 
1402.
Sentence 10: this is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel.
  13.224849506787775 
1403.
Sentence 11: therefore if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is 
a complete absence  of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person 
when the eyes are closed  and an object is handled the conclusion seems 
unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the 
third-dimensionality  of things and that actual sight or visual 
representations are  necessary.
Sentence 12: 5.1695071891800115 
1404.
Sentence 13: the force of the authors' analysis  can be felt by the reader i 
believe only after three  questions have been successfully answered.
  7.832328644858158 
1405.
Sentence 14: what allows us to think  that the patient had no third-
dimensional representations when his  eyes were closed?
  6.374930091531647 
1406.
Sentence 15:  what evidence is there that he was psychically  blind?
  13.195968635049278 
1407.
Sentence 16:  how can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly
  disturbed by his head injury?  8.489611535864501 
1408.
Sentence 17:  we shall consider these in the  inverse order of their 
presentation.
Sentence 18:  12.265526820187853 
1409.
Sentence 19: obviously a satisfactory  answer to the third question is 
imperative if the argument is to  get under way at all for if there is 
any possibility of doubt whether  the patient's tactual sensitivity had 
been impaired by the occipital  lesion any findings whatsoever in 
regard to the first question become  completely ambiguous and fail 
altogether of course as evidence to  establish the desired conclusion.
  5.290912277678595 
1410.
Sentence 20: the answer the authors give to it therefore is of supreme 
importance.
Sentence 21: 12.044144448452037 
1411.
Sentence 22: it is as follows: the usual sensitivity tests showed that the 
specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness  as well as the kinesthetic
  sensations were  as such essentially intact although they seemed in 
comparison with  normal reactions to be somewhat diminished over the 
entire body.
Sentence 23:  6.291470996684294 
1412.
Sentence 24: the  supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in 
the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member as well as
  the direction and scope of a movement passively executed proved to 
have been on the contrary very considerably  affected.
Sentence 25:  6.681805800004582 
1413.
Sentence 26: the authors insist however that these abnormalities in  the sense 
of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that  sense 
faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained  to 
the sense of sight.
Sentence 27:  5.346012869445197 
1414.
Sentence 28: first of all what is their evidence  that the tactual apparatus 
was fundamentally undamaged? 10.549054631422335 
1415.
Sentence 29:  when an object was placed in the patient's hand he had no 
difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold sharp or blunt rough 
or smooth  flexible soft or hard; and he could tell simply by the feel of
Sentence 1:   it whether it was made of wood iron cloth rubber and so on.
  5.219928071293269 
1416.
Sentence 2: and  he could recognize by touch alone articles which he had 
handled immediately  before even though they were altogether unfamiliar 
to him and could not be identified by him; that is he was unaware what 
kind  of objects they were or what their use was.
Sentence 3:  6.299198933199174 
1417.
Sentence 4: the patient attained  an astonishing efficiency in a new trade.
  9.574052594820632 
1418.
Sentence 5: because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his 
sight the patient had to train  himself for a new line of work that of 
a portfolio-maker an occupation  requiring a great deal of precision in 
the making of measurements  and a fairly well-developed sense of form and 
contour.
Sentence 6:  8.51852383809026 
1419.
Sentence 7: it seems clear  when one takes into consideration the exceedingly 
defective eyesight  of the patient  second question the one 
concerning the psychical blindness of the  that he had to rely on his 
sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio-maker and that 
consequently that faculty was most probably  more sensitive to shape and 
size than that of a person with normal vision.
Sentence 8:  5.9918007265612605 
1420.
Sentence 9: and so the authors conclude: the conduct of the patient in his 
every-day life and in his work even more than the foregoing  facts 
mentioned above under 1 leave positively no room for doubt  that the 
sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word was unaffected;  or to 
put the same thing in physiological terms that the performance-capacity
  of the tactual apparatus from the periphery up to  the tactual 
centers in the brain- that is from one end to the other- was unimpaired.
  7.692307498073053 
1421.
Sentence 10: if the argument is accepted as essentially  sound up to this point 
it remains for us to consider whether the  patient's difficulties in 
orienting himself spatially and in locating  objects in space with the 
sense of touch can be explained by his defective  visual condition.
  5.61887851585444 
1422.
Sentence 11: but before we can do this we must first find answers to our 
original questions 1 and 2; then we shall perhaps  be in a position to 
provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand.
  8.161297154572086 
1423.
Sentence 12: in what ways then did the patient's psychical  blindness 
manifest itself? 10.66101787283389 
1424.
Sentence 13:  he could not see objects as unified  self-contained and organized 
figures as a person does with normal  vision.
Sentence 14:  10.341068677090052 
1425.
Sentence 15: the meaning of this as we shall see is that he had no fund  of 
visual memory-images of objects as objects; and therefore he could not 
recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again.
  6.844411718742213 
1426.
Sentence 16: instead  he constantly became lost in parts and components of 
them confused  some of their details with those of neighboring objects 
and so  on unless he allowed time to trace the object in question 
through  minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to 
discover  its contours.
Sentence 17:  6.890469490964571 
1427.
Sentence 18: according to his own testimony he never actually saw things  as 
shaped but only as generally amorphous blots of color of a more or less 
indefinite size; at their edges they slipped pretty  much out of focus 
altogether.
Sentence 19: 5.747270502395169 
1428.
Sentence 20: but by the tracing procedure he could  in a strange obviously 
kinesthetic manner find the unseen form; could  piece as it were the 
jumbled mass together into an organized whole  and then recognize it 
as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned out to be.
Sentence 21: 7.630158624283312 
1429.
Sentence 22: if however the figure to be discerned were complicated  composed of 
several interlocking subfigures and so on even the tracing  process 
Sentence 1: failed him and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its 
parts.
Sentence 2: 0.0 
1430.
Sentence 3: this meant concretely that the patient could not read at all 
without making writing-like movements of the head or  body became 
easily confused by hasher marks inserted between hand-written words and 
thus confused the mark for one of the letters and  could recognize a 
simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing  it.
  7.174981641294489 
1431.
Sentence 4: the patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery  at 
all; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corrobora te
  him.
Sentence 5:  7.459773820305406 
1432.
Sentence 6: after a conversation with another man he was able to  recount 
practically everything that had been said but could not describe  at 
all what the other man looked like.
Sentence 7:  9.619966038091068 
1433.
Sentence 8: nor could he call up memory-pictures  of close friends or 
relatives.
Sentence 9: 7.118308360432635 
1434.
Sentence 10: in short both his own declarations  and his figural blindness 
when he looked at objects seem to present undeniable evidence that he had 
simply no visual memory at all.
Sentence 11:  7.533727914227042 
1435.
Sentence 12: he was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed 
precisely  because he could not assign it to a visual shape already 
learned  and held in visual memory as persons of normal vision do.
  6.151845692258662 
1436.
Sentence 13: he could  not recognize it; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it 
because he had no visual memory at all.
Sentence 14: 8.200736707514775 
1437.
Sentence 15: therefore his only recourse was to learn  the shape all over 
again for each new visual experience of the same  individual object or 
type of object; and this he could do only by going over its mass with the 
tracing procedure.
Sentence 16:  5.18698805348644 
1438.
Sentence 17: then he might finally recognize it apparently by combining the 
visual blot actually being  seen with tactual feelings in the head or 
body accompanying the tracing  movements.
Sentence 18: 7.783352347862678 
1439.
Sentence 19: this would mean it can readily be seen that again for each new 
visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated
  because of the absence of visual imagery.
Sentence 20:  7.121765966612089 
1440.
Sentence 21: as one would  surmise the procedure however could be repeated 
with the same object  or with the same type of object often enough so 
that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the 
tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape which the 
patient then immediately  could determine by a kind of inference.
  7.347465318148167 
1441.
Sentence 22: men trees automobiles houses and so on- objects continually 
confronted in everyday life- had each its characteristic blot-appearance 
and became easily recognizable  at the very beginning of tracing by a n 
inference as to what  each was.
Sentence 23:  4.782427601717655 
1442.
Sentence 24: dice for example he inferred from black dots on a white surface.
  7.391013650626644 
1443.
Sentence 25: he evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects
  but their size and the dots gave them away.
Sentence 26:  5.909009505545415 
1444.
Sentence 27: and the authors give  numerous instances of calculated guessing on 
the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of 
readapting himself  and how proficient he became at it.
  6.662863642189556 
1445.
Sentence 28: often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly without 
the tracing motions solely on the basis of qualitative differences among 
the blot-like things which appeared  in his visual experience.
  5.190428737797437 
1446.
Sentence 29: perhaps the very important question-  what is then exactly the 
role of kinesthetic sensations in the  patient's ability to recognize 
Sentence 1: forms and shapes by means of the tracing  movements when he is 
actually looking at things? 8.076113859240523 
1447.
Sentence 2: - has now been  raised in the reader's mind and in the following 
form.
Sentence 3: 5.277288353642859 
1448.
Sentence 4: if the patient  can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot 
perceive it visually  then it would seem the sense of touch has 
immediate contact  with the spatial aspects of things in independence 
of visual representations  at least in regard to two dimensions and as 
we shall see even  this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided 
touch is denied  by the authors.
Sentence 5:  7.800117953792519 
1449.
Sentence 6: how then do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this?
  7.8677709187355696 
1450.
Sentence 7:  the authors set about answering this fundamental question
  through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability tactually
  to perceive figure and to locate objects in space with his  eyes 
closed.
Sentence 8:  6.915848666227844 
1451.
Sentence 9: quite naturally they make the investigation first by prohibiting 
the patient from making any movements at all and then later by repeating 
it and allowing  the patient to move in any way he wanted to.
  5.5423911158436905 
1452.
Sentence 10: when the  patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at 
all the following  striking results occurred.
Sentence 11:  8.672286564180547 
1453.
Sentence 12: whenever artists indeed turned to actual representations or molded
  three-dimensional figures which were rare down to 800 bc they
  tended to reflect reality; a schematic abstract treatment of men 
and animals by intent rose only in the late eighth century.
  4.560595853257773 
1454.
Sentence 13: to speak of this underlying view of the  world is to embark 
upon matters of subjective judgment.
Sentence 14:  7.7301584124722975 
1455.
Sentence 15: at the least  however one may conclude that geometric potters 
sensed a logical order;  their principles of composition stand very 
close to those which  appear in the homeric epics and the hexameter 
line.
Sentence 16: 5.964133532885743 
1456.
Sentence 17: their world again  was a still simple traditional age which was 
only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life.
  6.873056576178914 
1457.
Sentence 18: and perhaps an observer of the  vases will not go too far in 
deducing that the outlook of their makers  and users was basically 
stable and secure.
Sentence 19:  5.535330184528866 
1458.
Sentence 20: the storms of the past had died away and the great upheaval which 
was to mark the following  century had not yet begun to disturb men's 
minds.
Sentence 21:  7.311018707717815 
1459.
Sentence 22: throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm severe 
serenity displays  itself.
Sentence 23:  7.030965030328297 
1460.
Sentence 24: in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel  one 
in its internal self-satisfaction but the best of the geometric  pins 
have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made  in 
the greek world.
Sentence 25: 7.455863291615242 
1461.
Sentence 26: the ninth century was in its artistic work the  spiritually 
freest and most self-sufficient between past and future and the loving 
skill spent by its artists upon their products is a  testimonial to 
their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated.
  5.173247456563615 
1462.
Sentence 27: geometric pottery  has not yet received the thorough detailed 
study which it  deserves  partly because the task is a mammoth one and 
partly because some  of its local manifestations as at argos are only 
now coming to light.
Sentence 28:  5.8429768720186015 
1463.
Sentence 29: from even a cursory inspection of its many aspects however the
  historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the 
progress  of the aegean world down to 800 bc   the general intellectual
Sentence 1:   outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now 
consolidated  to a significant degree.
Sentence 2:  4.837424933957377 
1464.
Sentence 3: much which was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well 
developed by 800.
Sentence 4:  8.30113943624519 
1465.
Sentence 5: in this process the minoan-mycenaean  inheritance had been 
transmuted or finally rejected;  the aegean world which had existed 
before 1000 differed from that  which rises more clearly in our vision 
after 800.
Sentence 6: 5.881478577874554 
1466.
Sentence 7: those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the 
fundamental continuity of aegean  development from earliest times- 
granted occasional irruptions of  peoples and ideas from outside- are 
correct; but all too many observers  have been misled by this fact 
into minimizing the degree of change  which took place in the early 
first millennium.
Sentence 8:  7.046926684865647 
1467.
Sentence 9: the focus  of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern 
districts of the  greek mainland and by 800 virtually the entire 
aegean always excepting  its northern shores had accepted the 
geometric style of pottery.
Sentence 10: 5.4147442380388755 
1468.
Sentence 11: while protogeometric vases usually turn up especially outside 
greece  proper together with as many or more examples of local stamp 
these non-greek  patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century.
  6.215959203217916 
1469.
Sentence 12: in their place came local variations within the common style-
  tentative as it were in protogeometric products but truly distinct
  and sharply defined as the geometric spirit developed.
  5.963087912880838 
1470.
Sentence 13: attica  though important was not the only teacher of this age.
  10.199045301202903 
1471.
Sentence 14: one can take  a vase of about 800 bc and without any knowledge 
of its place  of origin venture to assign it to a specific area; 
imitation and borrowing  of motifs now become ascertainable.
  5.761308961377743 
1472.
Sentence 15: the potters of the aegean  islands thus stood apart from those of 
the mainland and in greece  itself argive corinthian attic boeotian and 
other geometric  sequences have each their own hallmarks.
  7.150273158334768 
1473.
Sentence 16: these local variations were to become ever sharper in the next 
century and a half.
Sentence 17:  6.880944114051817 
1474.
Sentence 18: the same  conclusions can be drawn from the other physical 
evidence of the dark  ages from linguistic distribution and from the 
survivals of early  social political and religious patterns into later 
ages.
Sentence 19: 7.401229121130267 
1475.
Sentence 20: by 800 bc  the aegean was an area of common tongue and of common 
culture.
Sentence 21:  6.521322125807565 
1476.
Sentence 22: on these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which
  was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the 
iliad.
Sentence 23:  7.238599081909383 
1477.
Sentence 24: everywhere within the common pattern however one finds local
  diversity; greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized
  and plagued by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed 
factors.
Sentence 25:  5.026336780800867 
1478.
Sentence 26: further we cannot go for the dark ages deserve their  name.
  8.48113929740002 
1479.
Sentence 27: many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized
  to find expression nor could the simple economic and social 
foundations of this world support a lofty structure.
Sentence 28:  5.697294892059446 
1480.
Sentence 29: the epic poems the  consolidation of the greek pantheon the rise 
of firm political units  the self-awareness which could permit painted 
and sculptured representations  of men- all these had to await the 
progress of following decades.
Sentence 30:  6.773815154849202 
Sentence 1: 1481.
Sentence 2: what we have seen in this chapter we have seen only dimly and yet 
the results however general are worth the search.
Sentence 3:  7.878998474365192 
1482.
Sentence 4: these are  the centuries in which the inhabitants of the aegean 
world settled firmly  into their minds and into their institutions the 
foundations of the  hellenic outlook independent of outside forces.
  6.815549445754595 
1483.
Sentence 5: to interpret  indeed the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly 
of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our 
lack of detailed information; if we could see more deeply we probably 
would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end 
within the period.
Sentence 6:  4.9264434793706275 
1484.
Sentence 7: the historian can only point out those lines which were major
  enough to find reflection in our limited evidence and must hope 
that  future excavations will enrich our understanding.
Sentence 8:  6.453426237206616 
1485.
Sentence 9: throughout the dark  ages it is clear the greek world had been 
developing slowly but consistently.
Sentence 10:  8.121231513790214 
1486.
Sentence 11: the pace could now be accelerated for the inhabitants  of the 
aegean stood on firm ground.
Sentence 12: 8.003498092197411 
1487.
Sentence 13: the landscape of greek history broadens widely and rather abruptly 
in the eighth century bc the age of homer's  rosy-fingered dawn.
  6.6135937836147 
1488.
Sentence 14: the first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the 
dark shadows which lie across the aegean world;  but our evidence grows 
considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of 
change.
Sentence 15:  7.417974433639382 
1489.
Sentence 16: for this period as for earlier  centuries pottery remains the 
most secure source; the ceramic  material of the age is more abundant 
more diversified and more indicative  of the hopes and fears of its 
makers who begin to show scenes of  human life and death.
  5.06241439611083 
1490.
Sentence 17: figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and 
architecture in greece; objects in gold ivory and bronze grow more 
numerous.
Sentence 18:  6.44893033609597 
1491.
Sentence 19: since writing was practiced in the  aegean before the end of the 
century we may hope that the details of tradition will now be 
occasionally useful.
Sentence 20:  7.941244313576755 
1492.
Sentence 21: though it is not easy to  apply the evidence of the iliad to any 
specific era this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly 
taken definitive shape by 750.
Sentence 22:  8.800064024108055 
1493.
Sentence 23: the dipylon geometric pottery of athens and the iliad  are amazing 
manifestations of the inherent potentialities of greek  civilization; but 
both were among the last products of a phase which was ending.
  5.1258360333252 
1494.
Sentence 24: greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution  in 
which the developed qualities of the hellenic outlook were  suddenly to 
break forth.
Sentence 25:  6.637209929101421 
1495.
Sentence 26: the revolution was well under way before  700 bc and premonitory 
signs go back virtually across the century.
Sentence 27:  6.726009350745573 
1496.
Sentence 28: the era however is janus-faced.
Sentence 29:  13.848082117783294 
1497.
Sentence 30: while many tokens point forward  the main achievements stand as a 
culmination of the simple patterns  of the dark ages.
  5.640234305531537 
1498.
Sentence 31: the dominant pottery of the century was geometric; political 
organization revolved about the basileis;  trade was just beginning to 
expand; the gods who protected the greek countryside  were only now 
putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress.
Sentence 32:  6.6898948707734744 
1499.
Sentence 33: the modern student who knows what was to come next is likely  to 
place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth
  century.
Sentence 34:  5.565331198642477 
Sentence 1: 1500.
Sentence 2: not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis.
  13.785437300674355 
1501.
Sentence 3: many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were 
confronted with radically new ideas; the poet of the iliad deliberately
  archaized.
Sentence 4: 6.982078179306438 
1502.
Sentence 5: although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era i 
shall consider in the present chapter primarily the  first decades of 
the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first 
stage of greek civilization.
Sentence 6: 7.981602771143404 
1503.
Sentence 7: on this principle  of division i must postpone the evolution of 
sculpture architecture society and politics; for the developments in 
these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of 
revolution itself.
Sentence 8:  6.012785356369535 
1504.
Sentence 9: the growing  contacts between aegean and orient are also a 
phase which should  be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening 
of hellenic culture  after 750.
Sentence 10: 7.103179321311508 
1505.
Sentence 11: we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections  to 
the east as we consider ripe geometric pottery the epic and the myth and 
the religious evolution of early greece; the important  point however is 
that these magnificent achievements unlike those  of later decades were 
only incidentally influenced by oriental  models.
Sentence 12:  5.431519492104782 
1506.
Sentence 13: the antecedents of dipylon vases and of the iliad lie in  the 
aegean past.
Sentence 14:  9.469172564136413 
1507.
Sentence 15: the pottery of the first  half of the eighth century is commonly 
called ripe geometric.
Sentence 16: 6.932178049483514 
1508.
Sentence 17: the  severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years the 
strong  geometric style of the late ninth century display as firm a 
mastery  of the principles underlying geometric pottery; but artists 
now were  ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance.
  6.027996204038015 
1509.
Sentence 18: the vases which resulted  had different shapes far more complex 
decoration and a larger  sense of style.
Sentence 19:  6.196120048044738 
1510.
Sentence 20: beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of  this expansion we 
must consider the change in pottery style on broader  lines.
  6.945345300274609 
1511.
Sentence 21: in earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding  a 
fundamental sense of order after chaos.
Sentence 22: 7.879836024405837 
1512.
Sentence 23: they had had to work on very  simple foundations and had not 
dared to give rein to impulses.
Sentence 24:  10.020058785614506 
1513.
Sentence 25: the  potters in particular had virtually eschewed freehand drawing 
elaborate  motifs and the curving lines of nature while yet expressing a
  belief that there was order in the universe.
Sentence 26: 5.11429832726188 
1514.
Sentence 27: in their vases were embodied  the basic aesthetic and logical 
characteristics of greek civilization  at first hesitantly in 
protogeometric work and then more confidently  in the initial stages 
of the geometric style.

Sentence 7: some who have written on utopia have treated it as a learned
  diversion of a learned world a phantasy with which more amused

spirits a revel of debate paradox comedy and invention.
Sentence 8: 6.093656081597252 
1693.
Sentence 9: with respect to this view two points are worth making.
  7.187365013754166 
1694.
Sentence 10: first it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page 
utopia is described  as festivus gay.
Sentence 11: 10.304233160642921 
1695.
Sentence 12: it overlooks the other fact that it is described as nec minus 
salutaris quam festivus no  less salutary than gay.
Sentence 13:  6.853641928480741 
1696.
Sentence 14: it also overlooks the fact that in a rational  lexicon and quite 
clearly in more's lexicon the opposite of  serious is not gay but 
frivolous and the opposite of gay is not serious  but solemn.
  8.395362613648137 
1697.
Sentence 15: more believed that a man could be both serious and gay.
  7.849247445858565 
1698.
Sentence 16: that a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional
  illusion sedulously fostered by all too many academics who 
mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously 
because  they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the 
only mode  of expression their authors are capable of.
Sentence 17:  6.603967255903179 
1699.
Sentence 18: secondly to find a learned  diversion and a pleasing joke in more's 
account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars of the 
anguish of the poor  and dispossessed of the insolence and cruelty of 
the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin 
that would be surprising  in a moral imbecile and most surprising in 
more himself.
Sentence 19:  4.800773437968194 
1700.
Sentence 20: indeed  it is even surprising in the canon of christ church and 
regius  professor of ecclesiastical history who fathered this most 
peculiar  view and in the brilliant professor of medieval and 
renaissance english at cambridge who inherited it and is now its most 
eminent  proponent.
Sentence 21: 5.943773571418687 
1701.
Sentence 22: but to return to the main line of our inquiry.
  13.421664945931663 
1702.
Sentence 23: it  is doubtful that utopia is still widely read because more was 
medieval  or even because he was a martyr- indeed it is likely that 
these days many who read utopia with interest do not even know that its 
author was a martyr.
Sentence 24:  6.910725142464559 
1703.
Sentence 25: utopia is still widely read because in a sense more stood on the 
margin of modernity.
Sentence 26:  6.051743225543437 
1704.
Sentence 27: and if he did stand  on the margins of modernity it was not in 
dying a martyr for such unity  as papal supremacy might be able to 
force on western christendom.
Sentence 28:  9.251469489427912 
1705.
Sentence 29: it was not even in writing latin epigrams sometimes bawdy ones or
  in translating lucian from greek into latin or in defending the 
study of greek against the attack of conservative academics or in 
attacking  the conservative theologians who opposed erasmus's 
philological  study of the new testament.
Sentence 30: 5.696840260430347 
Sentence 1: 1706.
Sentence 2: similar literary exercises were the  common doings of a christian 
humanist of the first two decades of the  sixteenth century.
  8.129844902668426 
1707.
Sentence 3: had more's writings been wholly limited to such  exercises they 
would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other 
authors living in his time whose works tenuously survive in the minds of 
the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit  of their very 
specialized occasions read those works.
Sentence 4: 5.221902990449824 
1708.
Sentence 5: more stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone- 
because he wrote utopia.
Sentence 6:  7.810415301301886 
1709.
Sentence 7: and the evidence that he does indeed stand there  derives quite 
simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual  readers 
have responded to that book for the past century or so.
Sentence 8: 6.598230546198967 
1710.
Sentence 9: only one other contemporary of more's evokes so immediate and 
direct  a response and only one other contemporary work- niccolo 
machiavelli and the prince.
Sentence 10:  7.72117502115348 
1711.
Sentence 11: can we discover what it is in utopia  that has evoked this 
response?  10.193745589788241 
1712.
Sentence 12:  remember that in seeking the modern  in utopia we do not deny the 
existence of the medieval and the renaissance  there; we do not even 
need to commit ourselves to assessing  on the same inconceivable  scale 
the relative importance of the medieval the  renaissance and the modern.
  6.387172903026784 
1713.
Sentence 13: the medieval was the most important  to chambers because he 
sought to place thomas more the author of  utopia in some intelligible 
relation with st thomas more the martyr.
Sentence 14: 5.588703887562494 
1714.
Sentence 15: to others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance  of 
christian humanism the renaissance elements are of primary  concern.
  8.316142821001927 
1715.
Sentence 16: but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation; we want  to 
know why that book has kept on selling the way it has; we want  to 
know what is perennially new about utopia.
Sentence 17:  6.126180134758616 
1716.
Sentence 18: what is new  about it?  22.677757618045387 
1717.
Sentence 19:  to that question the answer is simple; it can be made  in two 
words utopian communism.
Sentence 20:  7.828780270395683 
1718.
Sentence 21: but it is an answer which opens the  door wide to an onrush of 
objections and denials.
Sentence 22:  13.105269881877826 
1719.
Sentence 23: surely there is nothing  new about communism.
  7.7953810700046535 
1720.
Sentence 24: we find it in plato's republic and  in utopia more acknowledges 
his debt to that book.
Sentence 25: 9.876981374156989 
1721.
Sentence 26: we find it in that common way of life h pleasing to christ and h 
still in  use among the truest societies of christians that is the 
better  monasteries which made it easier to convert the utopians to
  christianity.
Sentence 27:  6.69141149634059 
1722.
Sentence 28: we find it in the later stoic conception of man's natural condition
  which included the community of all possessions.
  10.799726421724195 
1723.
Sentence 29: this conception was taken up by the early church fathers and by 
canon lawyers and  theologians in the middle ages; and more was far 
too well read not  to have come across it in one or several of the 
forms thus given it.
Sentence 30:  6.081027325038086 
1724.
Sentence 31: but although the idea of communism is very old even in more's day 
and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 it  is not 
communism as such that we are concerned with.
Sentence 32:  7.325496292403985 
1725.
Sentence 33: we are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other 
species of the genus: platonic stoic early christian monastic canonist 
or theological  communism; we are concerned with utopian communism- that 
is simply  communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of 
utopia  as more conceived it.
Sentence 34: 4.982088086722686 
Sentence 1: 1726.
Sentence 2: perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity  of utopian 
communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier  types of 
communistic theory.
Sentence 3:  8.549480168129186 
1727.
Sentence 4: we will achieve a more vivid sense  of what it is by realizing 
what it is not.
Sentence 5:  10.730475444439154 
1728.
Sentence 6: in plato's republic  communism is- to speak anachronistically-  a 
communism of janissaries.
Sentence 7:  9.047975442535272 
1729.
Sentence 8: its function is to separate from the base ruled mass among  whom 
private ownership prevails the governing warrior elite.
Sentence 9: 5.650746150781882 
1730.
Sentence 10: moreover  it is too readily forgotten that in the republic what
  gave  the initial impetus to plato's excursus into the construction 
of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods 
wives and children was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of
  the individual human psyche; and it is to this problem that the 
republic  ultimately returns.
Sentence 11:  6.674330339536156 
1731.
Sentence 12: in more's utopia communism is not a means of separating out a 
warrior elite from the lumpish mass.

1732.
Sentence 14: utopian  communism applies to all utopians.

Sentence 15: and in the economy of the  book it is not peripheral but central.
  13.71127166671565 
1734.
Sentence 16: the concern of utopia is  with the optimo reipublicae statu the 
best ordering of a civil society; and it is again and again made clear 
that utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensible to 
that best ordering.
Sentence 17:  6.790628496489725 
1735.
Sentence 18: to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community
  of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors- in-spirit
  the monastic communities is with an appropriate shift of adjectives
  misleading in the same way as to derive it from plato's republic:
  in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical and 
intellectual athletes in the apostolic and monastic communities with
  an elite of spiritual and religious athletes.
Sentence 19:  5.240320169558137 
1736.
Sentence 20: the apostolic community  was literally an elite: chosen by 
christ himself.
Sentence 21:  9.430036403335416 
1737.
Sentence 22: and the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of 
volunteers selected only  after a novitiate which would test their

Sentence 23: finally the conception of the natural community of all possessions 
which originated with the stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by

philosophers of the  middle ages.
Sentence 24:  6.0352088719041825 
1739.
Sentence 25: in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of 
innocence before the fall of man.
Sentence 26: 7.4489019043886096 
1740.
Sentence 27: it did not serve to  contrast the existing order of society with a 
possible alternative order  because the age of innocence was not a 
possible alternative once man  had sinned.
Sentence 28: 8.558893150584547 
1741.
Sentence 29: the actual function of patristic-civilian-canonist-scholastic

  13.756933105628148 
1745.
Sentence 36: because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no 
man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his.
  7.682065645336881 
Sentence 1: 1746.
Sentence 2: indeed of all that is his every  man is by nature and reason and 
therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian.
  9.610874702553993 
1747.
Sentence 3: he is a trustee for the common good  however feeble the 
safeguards which the positive or municipal law of  property provides 
against his misuse of that share of the common fund  wisely or 
unwisely entrusted to his keeping.
Sentence 4:  6.086671158878822 
1748.
Sentence 5: in contrast to this stoic-patristic view utopia implies that the 
nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply 
the deficiencies of  municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea 
of human sinfulness  in a sieve.
Sentence 6: 8.095617244393683 
1749.
Sentence 7: the utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions.
  8.976097203071156 
1750.
Sentence 8: in  a properly ordered society the massive force of public law 
performs the  function which in natural law theory ineptly is left 
altogether to  a small voice so often still.
Sentence 9:  6.134376786444851 
1751.
Sentence 10: in all the respects just  indicated  utopian communism differs 
from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living 
plays a role.
Sentence 11:  7.19656741681345 
1752.
Sentence 12: neither from one of these  conceptions nor from a combination of 
them can it be deduced.
Sentence 13:  10.583829172177266 
1753.
Sentence 14: we do not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus found 
the  tales of the house of atreus among the folk lore of the greeks.
  6.990318931704133 
1754.
Sentence 15: in  a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions 
one may  find in it utopian communism remains as an integral whole 
original-  a new thing.
Sentence 16:  6.5062665218547036 
1755.
Sentence 17: it is not merely a new thing; it is one of the very  few new 
things in utopia; most of the rest is medieval or humanist  or part of 
an old tradition of social criticism.
Sentence 18:  8.85407928288562 
1756.
Sentence 19: but to say that at a moment in history something is new is not 
necessarily to say  that it is modern; and for this statement the best 
evidence comes  within the five years following the publication of 
utopia when martin luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the 
divine's  encounter with man.
Sentence 20:  7.218971680341956 
1757.
Sentence 21: new indeed is luther's perception but  not modern as anyone knows 
who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what luther 
was getting at.
Sentence 22:  5.316736446672056 
1758.
Sentence 23: although utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern it 
is not modern communism  or even modern socialism as they exist or 
have ever existed in  theory or in practice.
Sentence 24: 6.7355149487724075 
1759.
Sentence 25: consider the features of utopian communism:  generous public 
provision for the infirm; democratic and secret elections  of all 
officers including priests meals taken publicly in common
  refectories; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens;
  even houses changed once a decade; six hours of manual labor  a day 
for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars and careful measures
  to prevent anyone from shirking; no private property no money;
  no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services and therefore
  no market in the economic sense of the term.
Sentence 26: 4.497430251962994 
1760.
Sentence 27: whatever the merits of its intent utopian communism is far too naive 
far too crude to suit any modern socialist or communist.
  7.203780624792659 
1761.
Sentence 28: it is not the details of utopian communism that make utopia modern 
it is the spirit the attitude  of mind that informs those details.
  9.843276045140588 
1762.
Sentence 29: what that spirit and attitude  were we can best understand if we 
see more precisely how it contrasts  with the communist tradition with 
the longest continuous history the  one which reached christianity by 
Sentence 1: the way of stoicism through the  church fathers of late antiquity.

a murderer a man of blood and that he and  his associates with the 
assistance of republicans and abolitionists  had plotted not only the 
liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow  of state and federal 
governments.
Sentence 5:  7.406407422726786 
1765.
Sentence 6: the providence daily journal  answered the daily post by

by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on  the 
propagation of slavery in that territory call for a charitable
  judgment upon his recent efforts in virginia to undermine the 
despotism  from which he had suffered and commend his family to the 
special  sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence 
justice.
Sentence 24:  4.544304520807469 
1834.
Sentence 25: resolved h that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for
  resolute action.
Sentence 26: 8.090086871834746 
1835.
Sentence 27: resolved that we find in this fearful trage dy  at harper's ferry 
a reason for more earnest effort to remove the  evil of slavery from 
the whole land as speedily as possible h.
Sentence 28:  5.277318820493475 
1836.
Sentence 29: on the morning following the pratt hall meeting the editor of the
  providence daily journal wrote that although the meeting was
  milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar 
purposes  it could have been avoided completely.
Sentence 30: 8.36543660274874 
1837.
Sentence 31: rather than being deceived the eye is puzzled; instead of seeing 
objects  in space it sees nothing more than- a picture.
  6.445496664123035 
Sentence 1: 1838.
Sentence 2: through  1911 and 1912 as the cubist facet-plane's tendency to 
adhere to  the literal surface became harder and harder to deny the task 
of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-
undeceiving contrivances.
Sentence 3:  6.183186985638247 
1839.
Sentence 4: to reinforce and sometimes to replace the simulated  typography 
braque and picasso began to mix sand and other foreign  substances with 
their paint; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention 
to the reality of the surface and was effective  over much larger 
areas.
Sentence 5:  5.764218648621162 
1840.
Sentence 6: in certain other pictures however braque began  to paint areas in 
exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing.
Sentence 7:  8.392442651917648 
1841.
Sentence 8: these areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern stated the
  literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting
  contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it 
could be rescued- and set to shuttling again- only by conventional 
perspective;  that is by being placed in such relation to the forms 
depicted  within the illusion that these forms left no room for the 
typography except near the surface.
Sentence 9:  4.4918623870537076 
1842.
Sentence 10: the accumulation of such devices however soon had the effect of 
telescoping even while separating surface and depth.
Sentence 11:  9.329718690063466 
1843.
Sentence 12: the process of flattening seemed inexorable and it became necessary 
to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing 
with the illusion.
Sentence 13:  6.293482407274422 
1844.
Sentence 14: it was for this reason and  no other that i can see that in 
september 1912 braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting 
actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain  wallpaper to a drawing on paper 
instead of trying to simulate  its texture in paint.
Sentence 15: 8.40862933168598 
1845.
Sentence 16: picasso says that he himself had already made  his first collage 
toward the end of 1911 when he glued a piece of  imitation-caning
  oilcloth to a painting on canvas.
Sentence 17: 6.608654188169467 
1846.
Sentence 18: it is true that his first  collage looks more analytical than 
braque's which would confirm the date he assigns it.
Sentence 19:  11.95018499411066 
1847.
Sentence 20: but it is also true that braque was the  consistent pioneer in 
the use of simulated textures as well as of typography; and moreover he 
had already begun to broaden and simplify the  facet-planes of 
analytical cubism as far back as the end of 1910.
Sentence 21:  7.798869797692726 
1848.
Sentence 22: when we examine what each master says was his first collage we
  see that much the same thing happens in each.
  10.009650139710573 
1849.
Sentence 23: that braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal  by 
its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness the affixed 
paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a 
more  vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated 
textures  had ever done.
Sentence 24:  4.575231936727398 
1850.
Sentence 25: but here again the surface-declaring device both  overshoots and 
falls short of its aim.
Sentence 26:  9.063763358105355 
1851.
Sentence 27: for the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the 
affixed material and everything else  gives way immediately to an 
illusion of forms in bas-relief which gives  way in turn and with equal 
immediacy to an illusion that seems  to contain both- or neither.
  5.155399326705275 
1852.
Sentence 28: because of the size of the areas it covers the pasted paper 
establishes undepicted flatness bodily as more than an indication or 
sign.
Sentence 29: 13.06503371473196 
1853.
Sentence 30: literal flatness now tends to  assert itself as the main event 
of the picture and the device boomerangs:  the illusion of depth is 
rendered even more precarious than before.
Sentence 31:  5.061022894047201 
1854.
Sentence 32: instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and 
circumscribing  it the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it and
Sentence 1:   the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness 
with  which to finish as well as start his picture.
Sentence 2:  7.323443848917472 
1855.
Sentence 3: the actual surface  becomes both ground and background and it 
turns out- suddenly and paradoxically- that the only place left for a 
three-dimensional illusion  is in front of upon the surface.
  5.9103807356432965 
1856.
Sentence 4: in their very first collages  braque and picasso draw or paint 
over and on the affixed  paper or cloth so that certain of the 
principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into 
real bas-relief space- or to be about to do so- while the rest of the 
subject remains  imbedded in or flat upon the surface.
Sentence 5:  6.851875011958627 
1857.
Sentence 6: and the surface is driven back  in its very surfaceness only by 
this contrast.
Sentence 7:  7.5619610009659075 
1858.
Sentence 8: in the upper  center of braque's first collage fruit dish  a 
bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally  vivid sculptural 
effect as to lift it practically off the picture  plane.
  7.284888431826524 
1859.
Sentence 9: the trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed  between 
parallel flatnesses but seems to thrust through the surface  of the 
drawing paper and establish depth on top of it.
Sentence 10:  5.934725622977054 
1860.
Sentence 11: yet the  violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the 
paper and the  only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate 
window lettering manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place 
on the picture  plane so that it does not jump.
Sentence 12:  7.816019890583046 
1861.
Sentence 13: at the same time the wallpaper  strips themselves seem to be 
pushed into depth by the lines and  patches of shading charcoaled 
upon them and by their placing in relation  to the block capitals; and 
these capitals seem in turn to be pushed  back by their placing and by 
contrast with the corporeality  of the woodgraining.
Sentence 14:  5.685060518747864 
1862.
Sentence 15: thus every part and plane of the picture keeps  changing place in 
relative depth with every other part and plane; and  it is as if the 
only stable relation left among the different parts  of the picture is 
the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with  the surface.
  6.614900744526586 
1863.
Sentence 16: and the same thing more or less can be said of the contents  of 
picasso's first collage.
Sentence 17:  12.48426561568046 
1864.
Sentence 18: in later collages of both  masters a variety of extraneous 
materials are used sometimes in the  same work and almost always in 
conjunction with every other eye-deceiving  and eye-undeceiving device 
they can think of.
Sentence 19:  7.17395119863937 
1865.
Sentence 20: the area adjacent  to one edge of a piece of affixed material- 
or simply of a painted-in  form- will be shaded to pry that edge away 
from the surface while something will be drawn painted or even pasted 
over another part of  the same shape to drive it back into depth.
  5.3741721271424 
1866.
Sentence 21: planes defined as parallel  to the surface also cut through it into 
real space and a depth is  suggested optically which is greater than 
that established pictorially.
Sentence 22:  6.046219493410928 
1867.
Sentence 23: all this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to
  encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind 
it.
Sentence 24:  7.392144884266809 
1868.
Sentence 25: flatness may now monopolize everything but it is a flatness become
  so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself- at least
  an optical if not properly speaking a pictorial illusion.
  6.669091043463327 
1869.
Sentence 26: depicted  cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to 
the literal undepicted kind but at the same time it reacts upon and 
largely transforms  the undepicted kind- and it does so moreover 
without depriving  the latter of its literalness; rather it underpins 
and reinforces  that literalness re-creates it.
Sentence 27:  5.227113559961203 
Sentence 1: 1870.
Sentence 2: out of this re-created literalness  the cubist subject 
reemerged.
Sentence 3: 15.839022710561869 
1871.
Sentence 4: for it had turned out by a  further paradox of cubism that the 
means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely 
divergent from the means of representation  or imaging.
Sentence 5: 5.924143006945969 
1872.
Sentence 6: in the analytical phase of their cubism braque  and picasso had 
not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply  in order to 
preserve it; they had also had to generalize it-  to the point finally 
where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific 
three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely  as the illusion 
of depth and relief as such: as a disembodied  attribute and 
expropriated property detached from everything not itself.
  6.273115724412167 
1873.
Sentence 7: in order to be saved plasticity had had to be isolated; and  as 
the aspect of the subject  was transposed into those clusters of more or 
less interchangeable  and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which 
plasticity was isolated under the cubist method the subject itself became 
largely  unrecognizable.
Sentence 8:  5.821668751334879 
1874.
Sentence 9: cubism in its 1911-1912 phase  was on the verge of abstract art.
  7.615092762846159 
1875.
Sentence 10: it was then that picasso and braque were confronted with  a 
unique dilemma: they had to choose between illusion and representation.
  7.940053434527958 
1876.
Sentence 11: if they opted for illusion it could only be illusion per se-  an 
illusion of depth and of relief so general and abstracted as  to exclude 
the representation of individual objects.
Sentence 12:  7.544992431196737 
1877.
Sentence 13: if on the other hand they opted for representation it had to be 
representation per se- representation as image pure and simple 
without connotations  of the three-dimensional space  in which the 
objects represented originally existed.
Sentence 14: 5.4381683460706505 
1878.
Sentence 15: it was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear: the 
representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and 
literal surface  now that illusion and representation had become for the 
first time mutually exclusive alternatives.
Sentence 16:  7.94894832720447 
1879.
Sentence 17: in the end picasso and braque  plumped for the representational 
and it would seem they did so  deliberately.
Sentence 18:  10.530728638869983 
1880.
Sentence 19: but the inner formal logic of cubism  as it worked itself out 
through the collage had just as much to do  with shaping their decision.
  8.84590206424632 
1881.
Sentence 20: when the smaller facet-planes of analytical  cubism were placed 
upon or juxtaposed with the large dense shapes  formed by the affixed 
materials of the collage they had to coalesce-  become synthesized- 
into larger planar shapes themselves  simply in order to maintain the 
integrity of the picture plane.
Sentence 21:  5.615217721960097 
1882.
Sentence 22: left in their previous atom-like smallness they would have cut away 
too abruptly  into depth; and the broad opaque shapes of pasted paper 
would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane.
  7.22308603525201 
1883.
Sentence 23: large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert 
themselves as independent shapes and to the extent that they are flat
  they also assert themselves as silhouettes; and independent 
silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the 
subject  from which a picture starts.
Sentence 24: 5.089574935992049 
1884.
Sentence 25: it was  because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other 
reason- that  is because of the growing independence of the planar 
unit in collage  as a shape- that the identity of depicted objects or at 
least parts of them re-emerged in braque's and picasso's papiers colles
  and continued to remain more conspicuous there- but only as
  flattened silhouettes- than in any of their paintings done wholly 
in  oil before the end of 1913.
Sentence 26: 6.781089267002746 
Sentence 1: 1885.
Sentence 2: analytical cubism came to an end in the collage but not 
conclusively; nor did synthetic cubism fully begin there.
  5.236383152695367 
1886.
Sentence 3: only when the collage had been exhaustively translated  into oil 
and transformed by this translation did cubism become  an affair of 
positive color and flat interlocking silhouettes whose legibility  and 
placement created allusions to if not the illusion of  unmistakable 
three-dimensional identities.
Sentence 4:  6.200461707338752 
1887.
Sentence 5: synthetic cubism began with picasso alone late in 1913 or early in 
1914; this was the  point at which he finally took the lead in cubist 
innovation away from  braque never again to relinquish it.
  5.351618960068526 
1888.
Sentence 6: but even before that picasso  had glimpsed and entered for a 
moment a certain revolutionary path  in which no one had preceded him.
  9.323592251036969 
1889.
Sentence 7: it was as though in that instant he had felt the flatness of 
collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way 
back- or forward- to literal three-dimensionality.
Sentence 8: 6.425611220251034 
1890.
Sentence 9: this he did by using utterly literal means to carry  the forward 
push of the collage literally  into the literal space in front of the 
picture plane.
Sentence 10:  8.890041861443022 
1891.
Sentence 11: some time in 1912 picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in 
the  shape of a guitar; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of 
paper and four taut strings thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in 
real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a 
picture  plane.
Sentence 12:  4.583650624155594 
1892.
Sentence 13: the affixed elements of collage were extruded as it were  and 
cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief.
  7.7036145166949765 
1893.
Sentence 14: and without  high density in the core rapid-transit systems 
cannot be maintained  economically let alone built from scratch at 
today's prices.
Sentence 15:  5.780015580284884 
1894.
Sentence 16: however the building of freeways and garages cannot continue 
forever.
Sentence 17:  11.045492157375909 
1895.
Sentence 18: the new interchange among the four los angeles freeways including
  the grade-constructed accesses occupies by itself no less than 
eighty  acres of downtown land one-eighth of a square mile an area
  about the size of rockefeller center in new york.
Sentence 19:  5.592635127419237 
1896.
Sentence 20: it is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete 
constitutes what the law  calls the highest and best use of centrally 
located urban land.
Sentence 21:  10.073806918041567 
1897.
Sentence 22: as it affects the city's fiscal situation such an interchange is
  ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which 
should  be taxed to pay for the city services.
Sentence 23: 7.282524625225396 
1898.
Sentence 24: subways improved land values  without taking away land; 
freeways boost valuation less  and reduce the acreage that can be 
taxed.
Sentence 25:  7.238056180642532 
1899.
Sentence 26: downtown los angeles is already two-thirds freeway interchange 
street parking lot and garage- one  of those preposterous if 
statistics has already come to pass.
Sentence 27:  5.257307633900222 
1900.
Sentence 28: the freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and
  mitigates the access problem but it also acts inevitably as an 
artificial isolating boundary.
Sentence 29:  7.4566280023606915 
1901.
Sentence 30: city planners do not always use this boundary  as effectively as 
they might.
Sentence 31: 6.409536690321955 
1902.
Sentence 32: less ambitious freeway plans may be  more successful- especially 
when the roadways and interchanges are raised allowing for cross access 
at many points and providing parking  areas below the ramp.
  6.204855426926829 
Sentence 1: 1903.
Sentence 2: meanwhile the automobile and its friend  the truck have cost 
the central city some of its industrial dominance.
Sentence 3: 5.8019468101117315 
1904.
Sentence 4: in ever greater numbers factories are locating in the suburbs or
  in industrial parks removed from the city's political jurisdiction.
  8.255405050793478 
1905.
Sentence 5: the appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry
  which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and 
wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor.
  5.71810131098908 
1906.
Sentence 6: to light industry  the economies of being on one floor are much 
slighter but efficiency  engineers usually believe in them and 
manufacturers looking for  ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from 
turning to efficiency engineers.
Sentence 7:  6.300809634716768 
1907.
Sentence 8: this movement of industry away from the central cities  is not so 
catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe.
Sentence 9:  6.223081203743542 
1908.
Sentence 10: it  is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which 
formed the pattern  of virtually all american cities.
Sentence 11: 7.95603204054056 
1909.
Sentence 12: the big factories which are relatively near the centers of our 
cities- the rubber factories in  akron chrysler's detroit plants 
ussteel's pittsburgh  works- often began on these sites at a time when 
that was the  edge of the city yet close to transport and  power.
  5.788081919159148 
1910.
Sentence 13: the leapfrog was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine 
and the time when the belts of residence surrounding  the old factory 
area were not yet blighted.
Sentence 14: 7.497288527224647 
1911.
Sentence 15: the truck and  the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of 
freedom in selecting his  plant site.
Sentence 16: 6.040227447879625 
1912.
Sentence 17: until internal combustion became cheap he had to be near  a 
railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community  of 
lower-class homes.
Sentence 18:  7.817525253817118 
1913.
Sentence 19: the railroad siding is still important- it  is usually though not 
always true that long-haul shipment by rail is  cheaper than trucking.
  5.782847598766815 
1914.
Sentence 20: but anybody who promises a substantial volume  of business can 
get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these  days and many 
businesses can live without the railroad.
Sentence 21:  6.763332865946206 
1915.
Sentence 22: and there  are now many millions of workers for whom the factory 
with the big parking  lot which can be reached by driving across or 
against the usual  pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus 
lines is actually  more convenient than the walk-to factory.
  5.155500035426077 
1916.
Sentence 23: willow run general  electric's enormous installations at 
louisville and syracuse the pentagon boeing in seattle douglas and 
lockheed in los angeles  the new automobile assembly plants 
everywhere- none of these is substantially served by any sort of 
conventional mass rapid transit.
Sentence 24:  5.930123421182118 
1917.
Sentence 25: they are all suburban plants relying on the roads to keep them 
supplied  with workers.
Sentence 26:  8.865091841116 
1918.
Sentence 27: and wherever the new thruways go up their banks are  lined by 
neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry.
Sentence 28:  7.199656001293057 
1919.
Sentence 29: the  drive along massachusetts' route 128 the by-pass which makes 
an  arc about twenty miles from downtown boston may be a vision of the 
future.
Sentence 30:  5.3596486551143485 
1920.
Sentence 31: the future could be worse.
Sentence 32:  13.848082117783294 
1921.
Sentence 33: the plants along route 128  are mostly well designed and nicely set 
against the new england rocks  and trees.
Sentence 34: 6.727556652604531 
1922.
Sentence 35: they can even be rather grand like edward land's monument  to 
the astonishing success of polaroid.
Sentence 36:  9.493647800865702 
Sentence 1: 1923.
Sentence 2: but they deny the values  of the city- the crowded competitive 
tolerant city the melting  pot which gave off so many of the most 
admirable american qualities.
Sentence 3:  7.461231532667947 
1924.
Sentence 4: they are segregated businesses combining again on one site  the 
factory and the office drawing their work force from segregated
  communities.
Sentence 5:  7.955076995961806 
1925.
Sentence 6: it is interesting to note how many of the plants on massachusetts'
  route 128 draw most of their income either from the government
  in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements or from the exploitation
  of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly.
  7.301972951377558 
1926.
Sentence 7: while the factories were always the center of the labor market they 
were  often on the city's periphery.
Sentence 8:  9.012698603219029 
1927.
Sentence 9: in spreading the factories even farther  the automobile may not 
have changed to any great extent the growth  pattern of the cities.
  6.564544075999645 
1928.
Sentence 10: even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's motel has been 
relatively painless; the hotel-motel demarcation  is becoming harder to 
find every year.
Sentence 11: 8.023860528380537 
1929.
Sentence 12: what hurts most is the damage  the automobile has done to

Sentence 37:  8.184987634943223

  as an artist to assume that the rights and responsibilities of 
creative  individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to 
specific geo-political interests.
Sentence 39:  7.930643190096074 
2063.
Sentence 40: if this attitude is seriously questioned  in the soviet union it 
does not necessarily follow that the majority  of the society in

  unusual travelogue.
Sentence 14:  9.601741886163447 
2071.
Sentence 15: i am equally impatient with the shrug of the shoulder shake of the 
head of those who no longer care because they  have known it for so 
long; the aggressive disbelief of those who are  romantically lost in a 
semantic jungle of the word revolution; the belligerent denunciations by 
the sick fanatics of ignorance who  try to build a papier-mache wall 
of pseudo-patriotism on our physical  horizons.

palaces  of the kremlin.
Sentence 25:  6.93381805276375 
2077.
Sentence 26: if we thus spent our very first day in the midst of  a large 
number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national
  achievement our last day to us at least was equally impressive and
  very moving even though the crowds were absent and there was almost
  complete silence.

2078.
Sentence 28: we stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country  just 
outside of moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of  a russian

Sentence 29:  6.317991228648421 
2079.
Sentence 30: the grave about half-way between his home and the blue turrets of 
a small church  rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined

2080.

Sentence 11: a struggle that is  being waged all over the world in the half-
light of disinterest.
Sentence 12: 11.857226038602619 
2087.
Sentence 13: the  prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of 
expressions in  your country denied not only the existence of this 
conflict but it was  elaborated even further with an incredible 
semantic dexterity.
Sentence 14:  5.468901746529454 
2088.
Sentence 15: the socialist  environment it was stated had cross-fertilized 
these two extreme  seeds and was about to produce a new plant and 
fruit.

used to.

2092.
Sentence 23: after a while  we were perhaps less surprised but still puzzled 
when a friendly  discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most 
irrelevant and  illogical comparisons.

2093.
Sentence 25: a chance remark about lenin's sealed train  brought the rejoinder

2094.
Sentence 26: theories of the behavior pattern of population masses  were 
compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern  of 
gaseous masses.
Sentence 27:  7.604666493087551 
2095.
Sentence 28: no wonder that pozzatti and i had at times difficulty  in 
remembering the real purpose of our presence namely cultural  exchange.
  5.992799391385868 
2096.
Sentence 29: typical of such an experience was the occasion  of a somewhat 
formal official welcome in the offices of the union  of soviet 
artists.
Sentence 30:  7.264707011585602 
2097.
Sentence 31: we had looked forward to what we hoped to be our  first informal 
meeting with a number of moscow's artists.
Sentence 32:  7.5594740825260685 
2098.
Sentence 33: instead  we became involved in a series of friendly but overly 
formal welcoming addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in 
kind.
Sentence 34: 9.101534102823583 
2099.
Sentence 35: the terms  of friendship understanding cooperation etc tend to 
become  somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use.
  6.040227447879625 
2100.
Sentence 36: i can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and 
individuals between  our countries will not wear out all language 
pertinent to the occasion.

2101.
Sentence 38: the presiding female functionary of massive proportions and 
forbidding appearance initially did not contribute to the expressions of
  friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen 
representing  the arts.
Sentence 39:  5.844130587240352 
2102.
Sentence 40: it was only after we had responded with what i fear were
  similar cliches that she went into action by questioning our desire
  for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive 
Sentence 1: and  warlike actions by the us government in cuba and laos.
  7.307493479774024 
2103.
Sentence 2: she  retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our 
meeting might  well terminate right then and there.
Sentence 3:  5.236383152695367 
2104.
Sentence 4: unfortunately she returned later just as i had taken advantage of 
the friendlier atmosphere in the  room by stating that perhaps an 
unexpected result of the cultural exchange  program would be the re-
emergence of abstract art in russia  with social realism regaining 
dominance in the us.
Sentence 5:  6.675952771977414 
2105.
Sentence 6: this gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the 
petulant admonition  that we should not presume to lecture her on 
abstraction.
Sentence 7:  5.718993643496278 
2106.
Sentence 8: she  did not go so far as to say as was done on other occasions 
that  abstraction as well as impressionism were a russian invention that
  had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the ussr pozatti and 
i could not know then that we would experience  this sort of treatment 
more often in moscow than elsewhere.
Sentence 9:  7.402022986230212 
2107.
Sentence 10: we were  to discover in fact that quite a number of people share 
with us the impression that in contrast to other soviet regions moscow's 
atmosphere is depressingly subdued and official.
Sentence 11:  6.829022243131998 
2108.
Sentence 12: to have one's intentions  deliberately or unintentionally 
misunderstood is always a waste  of time.
Sentence 13:  11.155037549088396 
2109.
Sentence 14: until our moscow experience i had not considered it necessary  to 
prepare any argument formally or informally.
Sentence 15: 6.20902340932923 
2110.
Sentence 16: artists simply do  not talk to each other in that fashion; and 
furthermore i could  not presume the implication that i spoke for 
american artists as a group.

2111.
Sentence 18: to save time some clarification seemed necessary.

Sentence 20: the following  is a statement read to a large and friendly group 
of your fellow artists in leningrad:   we have come to your land with the
  express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and 
your  ways.
Sentence 21: 7.323197769752837 
2113.
Sentence 22: our presence here should also be considered further sincere 
evidence  of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to 
seek  any and all possible ways to effect closer peaceful ties among all
  people.
Sentence 23:  4.766150547538924 
2114.
Sentence 24: we are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future
  depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between
  individuals.
Sentence 25:  9.769675206434302 
2115.
Sentence 26: in spite of the relatively short period of time that we have 
experienced among you we have already seen many indications of  your 
character and spirit.
Sentence 27: 8.439928788414969 
2116.
Sentence 28: we are acutely aware that yours is a society which in spite of 
several wars and many privations has developed  itself into one of the 
foremost nations of the world.
Sentence 29:  8.99786200739055 
2117.
Sentence 30: your past history  is resplendent with the fruits of the 
intellect.
Sentence 31: 7.655753926704058 
2118.
Sentence 32: your present history  is equally admirable for its industrial and 
scientific achievements.
Sentence 33:  8.205142482231215 
2119.
Sentence 34: we have come to you to experience something of your way of life
  while also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours.
  8.536168516542052 
2120.
Sentence 35: while we as american  artists  believe deeply in the universal 
character of all intellectual  activity we would be less than honest 
with you or ourselves if we failed to state a specific attitude toward 
our own society as  well as the international community as a whole.
  6.357969977264153 
2121.
Sentence 36: in stating this position  we should like to make it clear to you 
that we cannot expect artists  and intellectuals in other lands to 
share our opinion in every respect.
Sentence 37:  6.23367665049665 
Sentence 1: 2122.
Sentence 2: as a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people
  so much that we will not presume to speak for all other american 
artists.
Sentence 3:  10.013009547019598 
2123.
Sentence 4: but certainly all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge
  and search for similarities between you and us but rather the 
thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead
  us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of 
misunderstanding.
Sentence 5:  6.177959318434381 
2124.
Sentence 6: like yourselves we have pride and love for our country.
  9.115841268383512 
2125.
Sentence 7: to many of us this is a land to which we or our parents fled from 
totalitarian  terror in order to live in dignified freedom.
  8.953477993787729 
2126.
Sentence 8: as artists we  feel the same obligation as do other individuals 
in considering ourselves  responsible citizens of a great nation.

2127.
Sentence 9: the sane society is an ambitious work.
Sentence 10: 8.976097203071156 
2128.
Sentence 11: its scope is as broad as the question: what does it mean to live 
in modern society?  9.35452167365515 
2129.
Sentence 12:   a work so broad even when it is directed by a leading idea and 
informed  by a moral vision must necessarily fail.
  5.7841270288675535 
2130.
Sentence 13: even a hasty reader  will easily find in it numerous blind spots 
errors of fact and  argument important exclusions areas of ignorance 
and prejudice undue  emphases on trivia examples of broad positions 
supported by flimsy  evidence and the like.
Sentence 14: 6.359052874429053 
2131.
Sentence 15: such books are easy prey for critics.
Sentence 16:  8.771033092947984 
2132.
Sentence 17: nor need  the critic be captious.
Sentence 18:  12.946764411202565 
2133.
Sentence 19: a careful and orderly man who values precision  and a kind of 
tough intellectual responsibility might easily be  put off by such a 
book.
Sentence 20: 5.694134829135892 
2134.
Sentence 21: it is a simple matter for one so disposed to take a work like the 
sane society and shred it into odds and ends.
Sentence 22: 9.516917760745065 
2135.
Sentence 23: the thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large
  and vigorous family- a motley jumble of discarded objects some 
outworn  and some that were never useful some once whole and bright but
  now chipped and tarnished some odd pieces whose history no one 
remembers  here and there a gem everything fascinating because it 
suggests  some part of the human condition- the whole adding up to 
nothing more  than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers 
and users.
Sentence 24: 5.203008301938112 
2136.
Sentence 25: that could be easily done but there is little reason in it.
 14.11974277275505 
2137.
Sentence 26: it would come down to saying that fromm paints with a broad brush
 and  that after all is not a conclusion one must work toward but an 
impression he has from the outset.
Sentence 27:  6.7176044642943795 
2138.
Sentence 28: i mention these features of the book  because they are inherent in 
the book's character and therefore must be mentioned.
Sentence 29:  8.913272091211942 
2139.
Sentence 30: it would be superfluous to build a critique around them.
  15.02125286435465 
2140.
Sentence 31: there are more substantial criticisms to be made of fromm's account
  of capitalist civilization.
Sentence 32: 15.516482489747535 
2141.
Sentence 33: it is worthwhile to recall that  fromm's treatment has both 
descriptive and normative aspects.
Sentence 34:  9.47607946111833 
2142.
Sentence 35: since i have already discussed his moral position that discussion is
  incorporated by reference into the following pages which will focus
  on the empirical and analytic side of fromm's treatment.
  5.950565555073685 
2143.
Sentence 36: i shall  first indicate a couple of weaknesses in fromm's 
analysis then argue  that granted these weaknesses he still has much 
Sentence 1: left that is valuable and finally raise the general question of a 
philosophical versus  a sociological approach to the question of 
alienation.
Sentence 2: 5.770037733481585 
2144.
Sentence 3: almost  no empirical work has been done on the problem of 
alienation.
Sentence 4: 10.976418189748117 
2145.
Sentence 5: despite  its rather long intellectual history alienation is still 
a promising hypothesis and not a verified theory.
Sentence 6:  6.454874691434237 
2146.
Sentence 7: the idea has received much  attention in philosophy in literature 
and in a few works of general  social criticism such as the sane 
society.
Sentence 8:  9.765991470953939 
2147.
Sentence 9: what is missing is  work that would answer presumably by the use 
of survey methods and guttman-type  attitude scales such questions as 
these: what are the  components of the feeling-state described as 
alienation? 6.06732482094703 
2148.
Sentence 10:  how widespread is alienation?  18.959357004774663 
2149.
Sentence 11:  what is its incidence among the various classes  and subgroups of 
the population?  8.156826195943506 
2150.
Sentence 12:  taking alienation as a dependent variable  with what socio-
structural factors is it most highly associated?  7.682241427012676 
2151.
Sentence 13:   considered as an independent variable how does it affect 
behavior  in various sectors of life? 5.913639529546835 
2152.
Sentence 14:  until such work is done there must  remain the nagging suspicion 
that alienation may be little more than an expression of the malaise of 
the intellectual who rejected by and  in turn rejecting the larger 
society projects his own fear and despair  onto the broader social 
screen.
Sentence 15:  6.296145276200928 
2153.
Sentence 16: i am not suggesting that  fromm ought to do this kind of work.
  11.464257604420723 
2154.
Sentence 17: nor do i think that alienation  is nothing more than a projection 
of the malaise of the intellectual.
Sentence 18:  9.787607995285752 
2155.
Sentence 19: i am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence
  comes in any discussion of alienation must be understood to have 
certain  important limitations.
Sentence 20: 6.011835411903733 
2156.
Sentence 21: until such evidence appears we must  make do with the evidence we 
have.
Sentence 22: 8.925582376413775 
2157.
Sentence 23: here perhaps fromm is vulnerable for he does not always use the 
best and most recent evidence available and he sometimes selects and 
interprets the evidence in rather special ways.
Sentence 24:  5.640089242660943 
2158.
Sentence 25: fromm's analysis of alienation  in the sphere of production 
centers around the concepts of the  bureaucratization of the 
corporation the separation of ownership from control and the broad
  dispersion of stock ownership.
Sentence 26:  6.0728624714611374 
2159.
Sentence 27: for all these  points he relies exclusively on berle and means's 
study of 1932 the  modern corporation and private property.
  6.521296698411119 
2160.
Sentence 28: the broad conclusions of that pioneering work remain undisturbed 
but subsequent research  has expanded and somewhat altered their 
empirical support has suggested  important revisions in the general 
analytic frame of reference and  has sharpened the meaning of particular 
analytic concepts in this area.
Sentence 29:  6.57283498824015 
2161.
Sentence 30: fromm seems unaware of these developments.
Sentence 31:  7.622507342753323 
2162.
Sentence 32: another example is his very infrequent use of the large amount of 
data from surveys  designed to discover what and how people actually 
do feel and think on  a broad  range of topics: he cites such survey-
type findings just three  times.
Sentence 33:  6.815722888938181 
2163.
Sentence 34: moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not
  always the only ones possible.
Sentence 35:  6.98709399282772 
2164.
Sentence 36: for example he cites the following  data from two studies on job 
satisfaction: in the first study 85 per cent of professionals and 
executives 64 per cent of white collar people  and 41 per cent of 
Sentence 1: factory workers expressed satisfaction with  their jobs; in the second 
study the percentages were 86 for professionals  74 for managerial 
persons 42 for commercial employees 56 for  skilled workers and 48 for 
semi-skilled workers.
Sentence 2: 6.922265917285735 
2165.
Sentence 3: he concludes that  these data show a remarkably high percentage 
of consciously dissatisfied and unhappy persons among factory and 
clerical workers.
Sentence 4:  6.618347809508719 
2166.
Sentence 5: starting  from other value premises than fromm's some analysts 
might conclude  that the percentages really tell us very little at all 
while others  might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low.
  5.867756097854561 
2167.
Sentence 6: eric hoffer  for example once said that america was a paradise- 
the only  one in the history of the world- for workingmen and small 
children.
Sentence 7:  5.9574180923949696 
2168.
Sentence 8: what matters is that while fromm's reading of the data is not the
  only one possible it is precisely the one we would expect from a 
writer  who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be 
happy and  satisfied.
Sentence 9: 7.598404158947778 
2169.
Sentence 10: fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction
  conducted by the opinion research corporation in 1945 in which
  49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much 
as  he could in a day's work while 41 per cent said he should not do
  his best but should turn out only the average amount.
  4.667035373045725 
2170.
Sentence 11: fromm says these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment 
are widespread.
Sentence 12:  7.615092762846159 
2171.
Sentence 13: that is one way to read the findings but again there are other 
ways.
Sentence 14: 7.820346456885255 
2172.
Sentence 15: one  might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal 
primary  associations in the factory an interpretation which would run 
counter  to fromm's theory of alienation.
Sentence 16:  6.921633646929956 
2173.
Sentence 17: or he might remind fromm that  the 41 per cent figure is really 
astonishingly low: after all the  medieval guild system was dedicated to 
the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only 
the average amount; and today's  trade unions announce pretty much the 
same view.
Sentence 18: 5.2512252661149335 
2174.
Sentence 19: in view  of these shortcomings in both the amount and the 
interpretation of  survey-type findings on public opinion and 
considering the criticisms  which can be brought against fromm's 
philosophical anthropology  such a passage as the following cannot be 
taken seriously.
Sentence 20: 6.765690349101724 
2175.
Sentence 21: are people happy are they as satisfied unconsciously as they 
believe themselves  to be?  7.162709377573845 
2176.
Sentence 22:  considering the nature of man and the conditions for  happiness 
this can hardly be so.
Sentence 23: 10.667445180478408 
2177.
Sentence 24: the ambiguities suggested  above stem from a more basic difficulty 
in fromm's style of thought.
Sentence 25: 6.637326681754935 
2178.
Sentence 26: he seems to use the term alienation in two different ways.
  13.131755713671161 
2179.
Sentence 27: sometimes  he uses it as a subjective descriptive term and 
sometimes as an  objective diagnostic one.
Sentence 28:  6.112852567754032 
2180.
Sentence 29: that is sometimes it is used to describe  felt human misery and 
other times it is postulated to explain unfelt  anxiety and 
discontent.
Sentence 30: 9.555542984138903 
2181.
Sentence 31: the failure to keep these two usages  distinct presents hazards to 
the reader.
Sentence 32: 7.513801238435493 
2182.
Sentence 33: it also permits fromm to do some dubious things with empirical 
findings.
Sentence 34:  11.838738193581237 
Sentence 1: 2183.
Sentence 2: when alienation is used  as an objective and diagnostic category 
for example it becomes clear that fromm would have to say that awareness 
of alienation goes far toward conquering it.
Sentence 3: 6.38270889009178 
2184.
Sentence 4: starting from this  and accepting his estimate of the iniquities 
of modern society it  would follow that the really disturbing evidence 
of alienation would  be that of a work-satisfaction survey which 
reported widespread stated  worker satisfaction rather than widespread 
stated worker dissatisfaction.
Sentence 5:  6.032823168715323 
2185.
Sentence 6: the point is that in a system such as fromm's which  recognizes 
unconscious motivations and which rests on certain ethical  absolutes 
empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition  the writer 
is urging at the moment.
Sentence 7:  7.275656140464657 
2186.
Sentence 8: thus in the example cited above  fromm rests his whole case on the 
premise that the workers are being  deprived unconsciously 
unknowingly of fulfillment and then supports this with survey data 
reporting conscious experienced frustrations.
Sentence 9:  6.7094122240182985 
2187.
Sentence 10: he has his cake and eats it too: if the workers say they are 
dissatisfied  this shows conscious alienation; if they say they are 
satisfied  this shows unconscious alienation.
Sentence 11:  5.913908389731324 
2188.
Sentence 12: this sort of manipulation is  especially troublesome in fromm's 
work because although his system is derived largely from certain 
philosophic convictions he asserts  that it  is based on empirical 
findings drawn both from social science and  from his own consulting 
room.
Sentence 13: 6.348513592991583 
2189.
Sentence 14: while the empirical psychoanalytic  label which fromm claims 
sheds no light on the validity of his underlying  philosophy it does 
increase the marketability of his product.
Sentence 15:  5.995390196651971 
2190.
Sentence 16: the final example of the failure to use available evidence
  though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far bee n 
considered comes from fromm's treatment of some other writers who have
  dealt with the same themes.
Sentence 17: 7.639212524229116 
2191.
Sentence 18: in a brief chapter dealing with various  other diagnoses he 
quotes isolated passages from some writers  whose views seem to 
corroborate his own and finds it most remarkable  that a critical view 
of twentieth-century society was already held  by a number of 
thinkers living in the nineteenth h.
Sentence 19:  5.20871252147164 
2192.
Sentence 20: he finds  it equally remarkable that their critical diagnosis and 
prognosis  should have so much in common among themselves and with the 
critics of the twentieth century.
Sentence 21: 7.618991898741296 
2193.
Sentence 22: there is nothing remarkable about this at  all.
  20.382054071433625 
2194.
Sentence 23: it is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's 
purposes.
Sentence 24:  16.635251464280763 
2195.
Sentence 25: there is a difference between evidence and illustration and fromm's
  citation of the other diagnosticians fits the latter category.
  11.599737281606284 
2196.
Sentence 26: glance at the list: burckhardt tolstoy proudhon thoreau london marx 
tawney mayo durkheim tannenbaum mumford a  r heron huxley schweitzer 
and einstein.
Sentence 27:  6.632349365895319 
2197.
Sentence 28: this is a delightfully motley collection.
Sentence 29:  21.720414160094613 
2198.
Sentence 30: one can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them 
very carefully and hearing only what one wants  to hear.
  8.389328918947916 
2199.
Sentence 31: the method of selection fromm uses achieves exactly that.
  10.220672023418954 
2200.
Sentence 32: furthermore  the list is interesting for its omissions.
  9.060328853487057 
2201.
Sentence 33: it omits for  example practically the whole line of great 
nineteenth century english  social critics nearly all the great writers 
Sentence 1: whose basic position  is religious and all those who are with more or 
less accuracy called  existentialists.
Sentence 2: 6.320878626527629 
2202.
Sentence 3: of course the list also excludes all writers who are  fairly 
optimistic about the modern situation; these almost  by definition are 
spokesmen for an alienated ideology.
Sentence 4:  7.986939146490382 
2203.
Sentence 5: it is not hard  to find that concurrence of opinion which fromm 
finds so remarkable  when you ignore all who hold a different opinion.
  7.47288586465558 
2204.
Sentence 6: turning from  these problems of the use of evidence one meets 
another type of difficulty  in fromm's analysis which is his loose and 
ambiguous use  of certain important terms.
Sentence 7: 7.596583429467451 
2205.
Sentence 8: one such instance has already been presented:  his use of 
alienation.
Sentence 9: 9.53533677413014 
2206.
Sentence 10: the only other one i shall mention here  is his use of the term 
capitalism.
Sentence 11: 11.534500564906686 
2207.
Sentence 12: for fromm capitalism is  the enemy the root of all evil.
  7.737557619512619 
2208.
Sentence 13: it is of course useful to have a sovereign  cause in one's social 
criticism for it makes diagnosis and  prescription much easier than 
they might otherwise be.
Sentence 14:  10.010636548054523 
2209.
Sentence 15: if one characteristic distinguishes boris godunov it is the 
consistency with which every person on the stage- including the
  chorus- comes alive in the music.
Sentence 16: 6.523798856294125 
2210.
Sentence 17: much of this lifelike quality results  from mussorgsky's care in 
basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections.
Sentence 18:  9.739721297461733 
2211.
Sentence 19: in this he followed a path that led back to the very  source of 
opera; such composers as monteverdi lully and purcell  with the same 
goal in mind had developed styles of recitative sensitively  attuned to 
their own languages.
Sentence 20:  5.815391374855542 
2212.
Sentence 21: through long experimentation  in his songs mussorgsky developed 
a russian recitative as different from others as the language itself.
  7.3322587471022365 
2213.
Sentence 22: giving most of his musical continuity  to the orchestra he lets the 
speech fall into place as if by coincidence  but controlling the pace and 
emphasis of the words.
Sentence 23: 4.9495055662483365 
2214.
Sentence 24: the moments of sung melody in the usual sense come most often when
  the character is actually supposed to be singing as in folk songs 
and  liturgical chants.
Sentence 25:  7.163114320776924 
2215.
Sentence 26: otherwise mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies  for prolonged 
expressions of emotion- boris' first monologue for example.
  6.069352188143241 
2216.
Sentence 27: even then the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word 
comes first in importance.
Sentence 28:  9.394553212230063 
2217.
Sentence 29: aside from boris himself  one need but examine the secondary 
roles to place mussorgsky among  the masters of musical portraiture.
  6.044347723395408 
2218.
Sentence 30: even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full 
personalities defined with economical precision.
Sentence 31:  7.808265573550954 
2219.
Sentence 32: consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action: pimen 
varlaam missail and the jesuit rangoni.
Sentence 33: 6.644249059316758 
2220.
Sentence 34: under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other; each 
musical setting has  an individual touch.
Sentence 35:  8.40828673942554 
2221.
Sentence 36: pimen is an old man weak in body- his  voice rarely rises to a full 
forte- but firm and clear of mind.
Sentence 37:  5.589010576882641 
2222.
Sentence 38: his calmness offers contrast to grigori's youthful excitement.
  9.631463447962453 
2223.
Sentence 39: a  quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appears 
whenever  the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his 
own past  life:    this theme comes to represent the outer world the
Sentence 1:   realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance quite distinct
  from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery.
Sentence 2:  4.789029027344989 
2224.
Sentence 3: it changes and develops  according to the text; it introduces 
pimen when he comes before  boris in the last act.
Sentence 4: 10.85864069485859 
2225.
Sentence 5: once he has been identified however a  new melody is used to 
accompany his narrative a bleak motif with barren  octaves creating a 
rather ancient effect:    an imaginative  storyteller pimen takes on 
the character he describes as if he  were experiencing the old 
shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure.
Sentence 6:  5.039456935538069 
2226.
Sentence 7: here the composer uses a favorite device of his the intensification
  of the mood through key relationships.
Sentence 8: 8.666035493847048 
2227.
Sentence 9: the original d minor seems  to symbolize blindness inescapable in 
spite of all attempts to move  away from it.
Sentence 10:  7.309755854513507 
2228.
Sentence 11: as the child addresses the shepherd in a dream light-  in the form 
of the major mode- begins to appear and at the moment  of the miracle we 
hear a clear and shining d major.
Sentence 12: 8.014277858073278 
2229.
Sentence 13: varlaam  and missail always appear together and often sing 
together in a straightforward  rhythmically  vigorous idiom that 
distinguishes them from  the more subtle and well-educated pimen.
  4.903693293796623 
2230.
Sentence 14: their begging song might  easily be a folk melody:    the same 
could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the 
final scene.
Sentence 15:  7.689530745144533 
2231.
Sentence 16: apparently their origin is humble their approach to life direct and 
unsophisticated.
Sentence 17: 6.4837705874630664 
2232.
Sentence 18: whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb
  them now.
Sentence 19:  9.205094467689216 
2233.
Sentence 20: missail is the straight man not very talkative  mild-mannered 
when he does speak.
Sentence 21:  5.825820622377272 
2234.
Sentence 22: varlaam is loud rowdy uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient 
with anyone who is not the same.
Sentence 23:  8.244980822622942 
2235.
Sentence 24: a  rough ostinato figure heard first in the introduction to the 
inn  scene characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes 
into  the action:    the song of kazan in which this figure  becomes a 
wild-sounding accompaniment fills in the picture of undisciplined  high 
spirits.
Sentence 25:  5.190291898193216 
2236.
Sentence 26: the phrasing is irregular and the abrupt key changes have a 
primitive forcefulness.
Sentence 27:  8.649006242526841 
2237.
Sentence 28: varlaam's music begins to ramble as he feels the effects of the 
wine but he pulls himself together  when the need arises.
  5.779136912329309 
2238.
Sentence 29: both monks respond to the guard's challenge  with a few phrases of 
their begging song; a clever naturalistic touch  is varlaam's labored 
reading of the warrant.
Sentence 30:  7.13876213627646 
2239.
Sentence 31: as the knack gradually comes back to him his rhythm becomes steadier 
with the rigid monotony  of an unskilled reader.
Sentence 32:  6.635131223833771 
2240.
Sentence 33: for the only time in the opera words  are not set according to 
their natural inflection; to do so would  have spoiled the dramatic 
point of the scene.
Sentence 34:  8.550165616409267 
2241.
Sentence 35: musically and  dramatically rangoni is as far removed from the 
conventional monk as  varlaam.
Sentence 36:  7.214872179278036 
2242.
Sentence 37: his music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality  that 
suggest somehow a blood-kinship with dappertutto in offenbach's
  hoffman.
Sentence 38:  6.966023347421749 
2243.
Sentence 39: his speech shows none of the native accent of the russian 
characters; in spite of the italian name he sounds french.
  7.178160509753413 
2244.
Sentence 40: his personality appears more striking by contrast with marina who
 is- perhaps purposely- rather superficially characterized.
  7.407049836017958 
Sentence 1: 2245.
Sentence 2: rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock a sudden open fifth
  in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it.
  5.20949005976464 
2246.
Sentence 3: the effect is as if he had materialized out of nowhere.
  11.261538969150815 
2247.
Sentence 4: he speaks quietly concealing  his authority beneath a smooth 
humility just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide 
the firm pedal point beneath them.
Sentence 5:  5.722903588005325 
2248.
Sentence 6: he addresses marina with great deference calling her princess  at 
first; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that 
he uses her given name placing himself by implication in the  position of 
a solicitous father.
Sentence 7:  6.4019660578626105 
2249.
Sentence 8: curiously this scene is a close  parallel to one that verdi was 
writing at the same time the scene  between amonasro and aida.
  7.0219898319458975 
2250.
Sentence 9: rangoni and amonasro have the same  purpose- forcing the girl to 
charm the man she loves into serving her  country's cause- and their 
tactics are much the same.
Sentence 10:  6.083151600268427 
2251.
Sentence 11: rangoni begins  by describing the sad state of the church; this 
brings a reaction  of distress from marina.
Sentence 12:  5.598483606048827 
2252.
Sentence 13: the music becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own 
sainthood: it is she he tells her who can  bring the truth to russia 
and convert the heretics.
Sentence 14:  7.127864319617783 
2253.
Sentence 15: as if in a trance  she repeats his words- then realizes with a 
shock her own audacity.
Sentence 16:  7.680163033479572 
2254.
Sentence 17: this is no assignment for a frivolous girl she assures him.

Sentence 18: now rangoni comes to the point and we hear for the first time  a 
long downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic  motif 
of his sinister power.
Sentence 19: 6.477579054244203 
2256.
Sentence 20: it is a phrase as arresting as a magician's  gesture with a piquant 
turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness.
Sentence 21:  11.02243407942966 
2257.
Sentence 22: another theme sinuously chromatic appears as he directs her  to 
gain power over grigori by any means even at the cost of her honor.
  6.035141527309219 
2258.
Sentence 23: coming from a priest the music sounds as odd as the advice:
  marina rebels at this suggestion.
Sentence 24: 6.757567981697296 
2259.
Sentence 25: her pride is as much at  stake as her virtue; she is the 
unattainable beauty the princess who  turns away suitors by the dozen.
  5.813198545147495 
2260.
Sentence 26: indignantly she denounces rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders 
him to leave her.
Sentence 27:  7.198778874655976 
2261.
Sentence 28: at once the  jesuit pulls out all the stops.
  12.778694209963412 
2262.
Sentence 29: to music of a menacing darkness  he describes the powers of satan 
gaining control of the girl poisoning  her soul with pride and 
destroying her beauty.
Sentence 30: 7.470208738340757 
2263.
Sentence 31: the combined threat  of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her 
and she falls terrified  at his feet.
Sentence 32:  6.422408906182968 
2264.
Sentence 33: with another sudden change of mood he is again calm and protective 
exhorting her to trust and obey him as god's spokesman- and the chromatic 
scale descends in ominous contradiction.
Sentence 34:  6.505545451539822 
2265.
Sentence 35: whatever the source of rangoni's power marina is his captive now; 
we  are reminded of this at the end of the next scene when his theme 
cuts  through the warmth of the love duet again throwing a chill over the
  atmosphere.
Sentence 36: 6.053142088582488 
2266.
Sentence 37: the most unusual feature of boris however  is the use of the 
greatest character of all the chorus.
Sentence 38:  11.707622941470449 
Sentence 1: 2267.
Sentence 2: this is the  real protagonist of the drama; the conflict is not 
boris versus grigori  or shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child 
but boris  versus the russian people.
Sentence 3:  6.112768918127908 
2268.
Sentence 4: mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the  extent to which choral 
scenes propel the action.
Sentence 5:  7.032105024464237 
2269.
Sentence 6: boris' first entrance seems almost a footnote to the splendor of 
the coronation scene  with its dazzling confusion of tonalities.
  5.15576524365156 
2270.
Sentence 7: we have a brief glimpse  of the tsar's public personality the 
official boris but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd-  a 
signigicant contrast  with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening 
scene its bitter resentment and fury in the final act.
Sentence 8:  7.718606425518384 
2271.
Sentence 9: one reason for the unique  vitality of the chorus is its great 
variety in expression.
Sentence 10: 7.440804311787194 
2272.
Sentence 11: it rarely  speaks as a unit.
Sentence 12:  18.949080935241245 
2273.
Sentence 13: even in its most conventional appearance the guests'  song of 
praise to marina there are a few female dissenters criticizing  the 
princess for her coldness.
Sentence 14:  7.125838474182799 
2274.
Sentence 15: in many passages- for example  the council of boyars- each 
section of the chorus becomes a character  group with a particular 
opinion.
Sentence 16:  9.262177519826015 
2275.
Sentence 17: hot arguments arise between tenors and basses who will sing in 
harmony only when they agree on an  idea.
Sentence 18: 5.870785048786693 
2276.
Sentence 19: the opening scene shows this method at its most individual.
  10.215943051012516 
2277.
Sentence 20: mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people those
  who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power 
without  understanding the causes.
Sentence 21:  5.8621295887008245 
2278.
Sentence 22: they are held in control by force but  barely.
  13.920557496750066 
2279.
Sentence 23: they will kneel and plead for boris' leadership in a strangely
  intense song its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for 
breath  but when the police with their cudgels move away they mock and
  grumble and fight among themselves.
Sentence 24:  5.311005835378197 
2280.
Sentence 25: there is a quick change from the plaintive song to a 
conversational tone.
Sentence 26:  15.923983504229168 
2281.
Sentence 27: hey mityukh asks one  group what are we shouting about?
  6.930141700027754 
2282.
Sentence 28:  and mityukh apparently  the intellectual leader of the crowd 
replies that he has no notion.
Sentence 29:  11.226761337922127 
2283.
Sentence 30: the jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return; then
  the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before 
ending  it with a wail of despair.
Sentence 31:  5.037374730288671 
2284.
Sentence 32: mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical  music with considerable 
dramatic force.
Sentence 33:  8.581436094141479 
2285.
Sentence 34: in pimen's cell the  soft prayers of the monks heard from offstage 
not only help to set  the scene but emphasize the contrast between young 
grigori's thoughts  and his situation.
Sentence 35:  5.312532867322121 
2286.
Sentence 36: this is especially striking between pimen's  quiet exit and 
grigori's vehement outburst against boris.
Sentence 37:  11.670818393025478 
2287.
Sentence 38: again as boris feels himself nearing death a procession files into
  the hall singing a hymn its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch
  to the grim atmosphere:  the words are hardly calculated to put the 
tsar's mind at ease.
Sentence 39:  4.87298115481748 
2288.
Sentence 40: they echo the words with which  he has described his own vision 
of the dying child who trembles and  begs for mercy- and there is no 
mercy.
Sentence 41:  8.366744007769604 
2289.
Sentence 42: the living as well as the dead now accuse him; this final reminder 
of his guilt is the fatal  one.
Sentence 43:  6.409396413845572 
Sentence 1: 2290.
Sentence 2: one of the outstanding assets of the present production is the 
restoration of the st basil's scene usually omitted  from performances 
and rarely included in a published score.
Sentence 3:  9.98639453439996 
2291.
Sentence 4: though brief  it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy.
  7.453151796471379 
2292.
Sentence 5: in addition  it is an important link in the plot giving us a 
revealing glimpse of  the people's attitude toward boris and the false 
dimitri.
Sentence 6:  7.790727819047552 
2293.
Sentence 7: the mayhem in the forest of kromy is a natural sequel.
  8.521295541842022 
2294.
Sentence 8: the st basil's  scene opens with little groups of beggars milling 
around the square the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny.
 0.0 
2295.
Sentence 9: in the  orchestra we hear first a hushed hesitant pizzicato 
figure then the insistent police motif as it appeared in the opening 
scene.
Sentence 10:  6.698442508233473 
2296.
Sentence 11: the service is over and a number of people come from the church
  with their spokesman mityukh in the lead.
Sentence 12:  11.69045443331077 
2297.
Sentence 13: they bring the news that  the pretender has been excommunicated; 
this is met with scorn by  the hearers who claim that mityukh is lying 
or drunk.
Sentence 14:  5.804269485817031 
2298.
Sentence 15: contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment solemn
  there is still more news mityukh  announces: they have prayed for 
the soul of the tsarevich.
Sentence 16:  6.361052125678128 
2299.
Sentence 17: so far these remarks like most criticisms of hardy have tacitly
  assumed that his poetry is all of a piece one solid mass of verse
  expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development.
  5.685722204246392 
2300.
Sentence 18: for critics  hardy has had no poetic periods- one does not 
speak of early hardy  or late hardy or of the london or max gate period 
but simply of hardy as of a poetic monolith.
Sentence 19: 7.571888905415643 
2301.
Sentence 20: this seems odd when one recalls  that he wrote poetry longer than 
any other major english poet: domicilium  is dated between 1857 and 
1860; seeing the moon rise is dated august 1927.
Sentence 21:  5.6022079535623135 
2302.
Sentence 22: one might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years some 
changes in style and method would have occurred some development taken 
place.
Sentence 23:  8.436592717451486 
2303.
Sentence 24: this is not however  the case and development is a term which we 
can apply to hardy  only in a very limited sense.
Sentence 25:  9.096890694722923 
2304.
Sentence 26: in a time when poetic style and poetic belief as well seem in a 
state of continual flux hardy stands out  as a poet of almost perverse 
consistency.
Sentence 27:  8.563285666197848 
2305.
Sentence 28: though he struggled with  philosophy all his life he never got 
much beyond the pessimism of his  twenties; the sober opinion of his 
letter to noyes written  when hardy was eighty years old is 
essentially that of his first philosophical  notebook entry made when he 
was twenty-five: the  world does not despise us: it only neglects us
  .
Sentence 29:  4.8274065004272115 
2306.
Sentence 30: and though in his later years he revised his poems many times the 
revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style  which he 
had established before he was thirty; so that while it usually  is 
easy to recognize a poem by hardy it is difficult to date one.
  6.618169004842615 
2307.
Sentence 31: there is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about
  hardy's development: he did develop toward a more consistent and
  more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely 
his.
Sentence 32:  8.267871549888163 
2308.
Sentence 33: there is only one hardy style but in the earlier poems that style
  is only intermittently evident and when it is not the style is the
Sentence 1:  style of another poet or of the fashion of the time.
  12.156028076306805 
2309.
Sentence 2: in the later poems  however the personal tone predominates.
  12.134450900135947 
2310.
Sentence 3: the bad early poems are  bad shakespeare or bad swinburne; the 
bad late poems are bad hardy.
Sentence 4:  8.09953302560164 
2311.
Sentence 5: there are two ways of getting at a poet's development:  through his 
dated poems and through the revisions which he made in later  editions of 
his work.
Sentence 6:  7.736290719947678 
2312.
Sentence 7: about a quarter of hardy's poems carry an appended date line 
usually the year of completion but sometimes inclusive  years or two 
separate dates when hardy worked  on the poem or an approximate date
  .
Sentence 8:  6.964837790668336 
2313.
Sentence 9: these dates are virtually the only clues we have to  the 
chronology of the poems since the separate volumes are neither 
chronological  within themselves nor in relation to each other.
  5.358627608314622 
2314.
Sentence 10: with the  exception of satires of circumstance each volume 
contains dated  poems ranging over several decades  ; the internal 
organization rarely has any chronological order  except in obvious 
groups like the poems of pilgrimage the poems of 1912-13 and the war 
poems.
Sentence 11:  6.063719690941672 
2315.
Sentence 12: from the dated poems  we can venture certain conclusions about 
hardy's career in poetry  always remembering that conclusions based on 
a fraction of the whole  must remain tentative.
Sentence 13: 6.2844189372966195 
2316.
Sentence 14: the dated poems suggest that while hardy's  concern with poetry 
may have been constant his production was not.
Sentence 15:  8.112018110528632 
2317.
Sentence 16: he had two productive periods one in the late 1860's the other
  in the decade from 1910 to 1920  latter period and these alone 
total about one-tenth of all hardy's  .
Sentence 17:  6.231425616445089 
2318.
Sentence 18: there was one sterile period: only one poem is dated between 1872 
and 1882 and except for the poems written on the trip to italy  in 
1887 very few from 1882 to 1890.
Sentence 19:  8.649579383475903 
2319.
Sentence 20: the dated poems also  give us an idea of the degree to which hardy 
drew upon past productions  for his various volumes and therefore 
probably are an indication  of the amount of poetry he was writing at the 
time.
Sentence 21: 6.222596295354519 
2320.
Sentence 22: poems of the past  and the present and time's laughingstocks 
both published  while hardy was at work on the dynasts draw heavily on 
poems written before 1900.
Sentence 23:  6.567145176406102 
2321.
Sentence 24: satires of circumstance and moments of vision coming during his 
most productive decade are relatively self-contained;  the former 
contains no poem dated before 1909-10- that  is no poem from a period 
covered by a previous volume- and the  latter has only a few such.
  4.660802049974593 
2322.
Sentence 25: the last three volumes are again more dependent  on the past as 
hardy's creative powers declined in his old  age.
Sentence 26:  8.370426229102053 
2323.
Sentence 27: these observations about hardy's productivity tally with  the 
details of his life as we know them.
Sentence 28:  7.947046214064194 
2324.
Sentence 29: the first productive period came when he was considering poetry as 
a vocation before he had decided  to write fiction for a living  he 
wrote that he wrote verses 1865-1868; gave up verse for prose .
  7.018059705840409 
2325.
Sentence 30: during the poetically sterile  years he was writing novels at 
the rate of almost one a year and was  in addition burdened with bad 
health  .
Sentence 31:  7.6633775472892625 
2326.
Sentence 32: two entries in the early life support the assumption that
  during this period hardy had virtually suspended the writing of 
poetry.
Sentence 33:  7.874890637764374 
Sentence 1: 2327.
Sentence 2: mrs hardy records that h at the end of november 1881  he makes a 
note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible  ; and on 
christmas day 1890 hardy  wrote: while thinking of resuming 'the 
viewless wings of  poesy' before dawn this morning new horizons 
seemed to open and worrying pettinesses to disappear.
Sentence 3:  5.083061685496505 
2328.
Sentence 4: there are more poems dated in the 1890's than in the '80's- hardy
  had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the 
volume  of his fiction- but none in 1891 the year of tess and only one
  in 1895 the year of jude.
Sentence 5:  6.137477936128797 
2329.
Sentence 6: after 1895 the number increases and  in the next thirty years 
there is only one year for which there is no dated poem- 1903 when hardy 
was at work on the dynasts.
Sentence 7: 6.653524911042454 
2330.
Sentence 8: the second productive period the decade from 1910 to 1920 can  be 
related to three events: the completion of the dynasts in 1909  which 
left hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years;  the 
death of emma hardy in 1912 which had a profound emotional  effect on 
hardy for which he found release in poetry; and the first  world war.
  7.068077781103549 
2331.
Sentence 9: it may seem strange that a poet should come to full  fruition in 
his seventies but we have it on hardy's own authority  that h he was a 
child till he was sixteen a youth till he was  five-and-twenty  and a 
young man till he was nearly fifty  life  .
Sentence 10:  6.230814457743788 
2332.
Sentence 11: we may carry this sequence one step further and say  that at 
seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers wanting only  the 
impetus of two tragedies one personal the other national to  loose those 
powers in poetry.
Sentence 12:  7.3913825035677805 
2333.
Sentence 13: hardy's two productive decades  were separated by forty years yet 
between them he developed only in that he became more steadily himself- 
it was a narrowing not an expanding  process.
Sentence 14:  5.074510734093508 
2334.
Sentence 15: like a wise gardener hardy pruned away the shakespearian
  sonnets and songs and the elements of meter and poetic diction
  to which his personal style was not suited and let the main stock
  of his talent flourish.
Sentence 16:  6.760583683442797 
2335.
Sentence 17: the range of the later poetry is considerably  narrower but the 
number of successful poems is far greater.
Sentence 18:  7.518574669670681 
2336.
Sentence 19: we  can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if 
we look  at two poems of very different qualities: revulsion  and 
neutral tones.
Sentence 20:  6.6100764004040125 
2337.
Sentence 21: there is not much to be said for revulsion.
Sentence 22:  28.46342986330878 
2338.
Sentence 23: like about half of the 1860-70 poems it is a sonnet  on a 
conventional theme- the unhappiness of love.
Sentence 24: 9.812490293835694 
2339.
Sentence 25: almost anyone could  have written it; it is competent in the sense 
that it makes a coherent  statement without violating the rules of the 
sonnet form but it  is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike 
hardy.
Sentence 26:  6.3518786607357 
2340.
Sentence 27: the language  is the conventional language of the form; there is 
no phrase or image  that sounds like hardy or that is striking enough 
to give individuality to the poem.
Sentence 28:  7.341668954455712 
2341.
Sentence 29: it is smoother than hardy usually is but with the smoothness of 
anonymity.
Sentence 30: 10.046011291162289 
2342.
Sentence 31: it is obviously a young man's poem written  out of books and not 
out of experience; it asserts emotion  without evoking it- that is to 
say it is sentimental.
Sentence 32: 11.232402478716416 
2343.
Sentence 33: there are many  such competently anonymous performances among the 
earlier poems.
Sentence 34:  11.130481812445225 
2344.
Sentence 35: neutral tones we immediately recognize as a fine poem in
  hardy's most characteristic style: the plain but not quite 
colloquial language the hard particular colorless images the slightly odd
  stanza-form the dramatic handling of the occasion the refusal to
Sentence 1:   resolve the issue- all these we have seen in hardy's best poems.
  5.910250016824062 
2345.
Sentence 2: the poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on 
exotic  sources of diction yet it is obviously not ordinary speech-
  only hardy would say a grin of bitterness swept therebylike an
  ominous bird a-wing or wrings with wrong or would describe  a 
winter sun as god-curst.
Sentence 3:  4.765491282338729 
2346.
Sentence 4: the details of the setting  of neutral tones are not strictly 
speaking metaphorical but  they combine to create a mood which is 
appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love and in this 
way love and weather the  emotions and the elements symbolize each 
other in a way that is common  to many of hardy's best poems  and 
to  some moving passages in the novels as well  .
Sentence 5:  8.75919743257224 
2347.
Sentence 6: neutral  tones is an excellent example of hardy's mature style 
drawn from his earliest productive period; i cite it as evidence that he
  did not develop through new styles as he grew older  but that he 
simply learned to use better what he already had.
Sentence 7:  4.6476390623530195 
2348.
Sentence 8: in the  poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the 
world; if  it is somber it is also precise and the precision lends 
authority to  the vision.
Sentence 9: 7.696337955461577 
2349.
Sentence 10: in revulsion on the other hand the pessimism is  a case not 
proven; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's  right 
to speak as he does.
Sentence 11:  6.875745358358814 
2350.
Sentence 12: in the 1860-70 decade there are  many poems like revulsion but 
there is only one neutral tones.
Sentence 13:  13.696834210325305 
2351.
Sentence 14: hardy was not hardy very often.
Sentence 15:  7.622507342753323 
2352.
Sentence 16: the poems of 1912-13  offer a good example of hardy's style as it 
was manifested  in the later productive decade.
Sentence 17:  8.241635904246959 
2353.
Sentence 18: these are the poems hardy wrote after  the death of his first wife; 
they compose a painful elegy to what  might have been to a marriage 
that began with a promise of happiness and ended in long years of 
suffering and hatred.
Sentence 19: 5.578255752184274 
2354.
Sentence 20: hardy obviously felt  that these poems were peculiarly personal and 
private; he sometimes called them an expiation and he would not allow 
them to be published  in periodicals.
Sentence 21:  6.714116470895795 
2355.
Sentence 22: they are the only poems that he rearranged as  a group between 
their first appearance and the publication of the collected poems.
  6.613280256005584 
2356.
Sentence 23: the elegiac  tone is hardy's natural tone of voice and it is 
not surprising  that the 1912-13 poems are consistently and unmistakably 
his.

Sentence 26: 5.587104705062957 
2358.
Sentence 27: the  poems are the epigraph tells us the traces of an ancient

uncomforted.

with a perspective which was not distorted  by exasperation or fatigue.

accelerated personal conflagration.

Sentence 30:  10.86495568007656 
2378.
Sentence 31: they were both very fluent.
Sentence 32: 18.417974109049254 
2379.
Sentence 33: but this fluent enchanting utterance had  compared with 
important artists of the past relatively little content.
Sentence 34: 8.232402233828171 
2380.
Sentence 35: neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture
  at his own creativity.
Sentence 36: 8.904469603528446 
2381.

Sentence 39: music of course is not so explicit an art but anybody who knew
  charlie parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own
  gift.
Sentence 40: 8.50701440888751 
2383.
Sentence 41: both of them did communicate one central theme: against the  ruin 
of the world there is only one defense- the creative act.
  9.4266575257164 
2384.
Sentence 42: this of course is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry.
  9.14660686660279 
2385.
Sentence 43: it is the theme of horace who certainly otherwise bears little 
resemblance to parker or thomas.
Sentence 44:  7.456160179316808 
2386.
Sentence 45: the difference is that horace accepted his theme  with a kind of 
silken assurance.
Sentence 46:  12.803716807082662 
2387.
Sentence 47: to dylan and bird it was an agony and terror.
Sentence 48: 8.786420140744127 
2388.
Sentence 49: i do not believe that this is due to anything especially
  frightful about their relationship to their own creativity.
  16.127195476323095 
2389.
Sentence 50: i believe  rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which

Sentence 52: horace's column of imperishable  verse shines quietly enough in

Sentence 1: 2391.
Sentence 2: art  may have been for him the most enduring orderly and noble 
activity  of man.
Sentence 3:  6.578086170536535 
2392.
Sentence 4: but the other activities of his life partook of these values.
  13.821102766683222 
2393.
Sentence 5: they did not actively negate them.
Sentence 6:  15.468949783101795 
2394.

2395.
Sentence 9: he was  able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the 
answer to air  raids and gas ovens.
Sentence 10:  8.86346437560069 
2396.
Sentence 11: as the world began to take on the guise of an immense  air raid or 
gas oven i believe his art became meaningless to him.
Sentence 12:  9.380083049246991 
2397.
Sentence 13: i think all this could apply to parker just as well although 
because  of the nature of music it is not demonstrable- at least not
  conclusively.
Sentence 14:  7.309552660892469 
2398.
Sentence 15: thomas and parker have more in common than theme  attitude life 
pattern.
Sentence 16:  8.129673677907498 
2399.
Sentence 17: in the practice of their art there is an  obvious technical 
resemblance.
Sentence 18:  10.973968230228177 
2400.
Sentence 19: contrary to popular belief they were  not great technical 
innovators.
Sentence 20: 9.668999315049774 
2401.
Sentence 21: their effects are only superficially  startling.
Sentence 22: 9.316814069021792 
2402.
Sentence 23: thomas is a regression from the technical originality and
  ingenuity of writers like pierre reverdy or apollinaire.
  7.097229679741538 
2403.
Sentence 24: similarly  the innovations of bop and of parker particularly have 
been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with music especially by that 
ignoramus  the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado.
  4.76581317220898 
2404.
Sentence 25: the tonal novelties  consist in the introduction of a few chords 
used in classical music  for centuries.
Sentence 26:  9.420170092916738 
2405.
Sentence 27: and there is less rhythmic difference between progressive  jazz 
no matter how progressive and dixieland than there is  between two 
movements of many conventional symphonies.
Sentence 28:  7.621336873942011 
2406.
Sentence 29: what parker  and his contemporaries- gillespie davis monk roach
 etc- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation  of the older jazz 
into the basic structure of which it then became  an integral part and 
with which it then developed.
Sentence 30:  6.825570308604376 
2407.
Sentence 31: this is true  of the melodic line which could be put together 
from selected passages of almost anybody- benny carter johnny hodges.
  7.288790332174263 
2408.
Sentence 32: it is true of  the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts 
continuously or at least  is continuously sprung so that it becomes 
ambiguous enough to allow  the pattern to be dominated by the long 
pulsations of the phrase or strophe.
Sentence 33:  8.846349138399919 
2409.
Sentence 34: this is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque  to 
rococo music.
Sentence 35:  11.90733603805121 
2410.
Sentence 36: it is the difference between bach and mozart.
  25.030810209903233 
2411.
Sentence 37: it is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what thomas
  did to poetry.
Sentence 38:  16.857931246053788 
2412.
Sentence 39: the special syntactical effects of a rimbaud or an edith
  sitwell- actually ornaments- become the main concern.
  7.663024046550707 
2413.
Sentence 40: the metaphysical conceits which fascinate the reactionary 
generation still dominant in backwater american colleges were 
embroideries.
Sentence 41:  6.374057384651866 
2414.
Sentence 42: thomas's  ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves.
  9.060328853487057 
2415.
Sentence 43: the immediate  theme if it exists is incidental and his main 
theme- the terror of  birth- is simply reiterated.
Sentence 44: 5.902564164932943 
Sentence 1: 2416.
Sentence 2: this is one difference between  bird and dylan which should be 
pointed out.
Sentence 3:  17.43661410097315 
2417.
Sentence 4: again contrary to popular  belief there is nothing crazy or 
frantic about parker either musically  or emotionally.
Sentence 5:  6.573304028508401 
2418.
Sentence 6: his sinuous melody is a sort of nai^ve transcendence  of all 
experience.
Sentence 7: 9.954970500597222 
2419.
Sentence 8: emotionally it does not resemble berlioz  or wagner; it 
resembles mozart.
Sentence 9:  7.111950423066715 
2420.
Sentence 10: this is true also of a painter  like jackson pollock.
  16.6443136855081 
2421.
Sentence 11: he may have been eccentric in his behavior  but his paintings are 
as impassive as persian tiles.
Sentence 12:  8.45074812051215 
2422.
Sentence 13: partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication.
  11.763412678947764 
2423.
Sentence 14: the insistent talk-aboutiveness  of the general environment 
obtrudes into even the most idyllic poetry.
Sentence 15:  6.817408452020724 
2424.
Sentence 16: it is much more a personal difference.
Sentence 17: 25.534126320034105 
2425.
Sentence 18: thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder 
of the world.
Sentence 19:  6.376389380082628 
2426.
Sentence 20: parker and pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the 
world.
Sentence 21:  8.979297569300416 
2427.
Sentence 22: technique pure and simple rendition is not of major importance
  but it is interesting that parker following lester young was  one 
of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution.
Sentence 23:  5.826846564016283 
2428.
Sentence 24: in modern  jazz the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played 
with conventional  embouchure.
Sentence 25: 9.034290540572359 
2429.
Sentence 26: metrically thomas's verse was extremely conventional  as wa s 
incidentally the verse of that other tragic enrage hart crane.
  5.463700333582356 
2430.
Sentence 27: i want to make clear what i consider the one technical  development 
in the first wave of significant post-war arts.
Sentence 28:  10.278985398086874 
2431.
Sentence 29: ornament  is confabulation in the interstices of structure.
  7.14162538120728 
2432.
Sentence 30: a poem by dylan thomas a saxophone solo by charles parker a 
painting by jackson  pollock- these are pure confabulations as ends in 
themselves.
Sentence 31: 6.731381435890986 
2433.
Sentence 32: confabulation  has come to determine structure.
Sentence 33:  8.254441635698543 
2434.
Sentence 34: uninhibited lyricism should be distinguished from its exact 
opposite- the sterile extraneous  invention of the corn-belt 
metaphysicals or present blight of poetic  professors.
Sentence 35: 6.365727389270327 
2435.
Sentence 36: just as hart crane had little influence on anyone except very 
reactionary writers- like allen tate for instance  to whom valery was the 
last word in modern poetry and the felicities  of an apollinaire let 
alone a paul eluard were nonsense- so dylan  thomas's influence has been 
slight indeed.
Sentence 37:  4.843286672736022 
2436.
Sentence 38: in fact his only disciple- the only person to imitate his style- 
was w s graham  who seems to have imitated him without much 
understanding and  who has since moved on to other methods.
  7.652274728384885 
2437.
Sentence 39: thomas's principal influence  lay in the communication of an 
attitude- that of the now extinct british romantic school of the new 
apocalypse- henry treece j  f hendry and others- all of whom were quite 
conventional  poets.
Sentence 40:  5.6427274801111595 
2438.
Sentence 41: parker certainly had much more of an influence.
  11.021613183094136 
2439.
Sentence 42: at one  time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in 
every high school  band in america to blow like bird.
  6.370277482455107 
2440.
Sentence 43: even before his death this influence  had begun to ebb.
  14.764505849123005 
Sentence 1: 2441.
Sentence 2: in fact the whole generation of the founding fathers of bop- 
gillespie monk davis blakey and the  rest- are just now at a 
considerable discount.
Sentence 3: 7.283710886717415 
2442.
Sentence 4: the main line of development  today goes back to lester young 
and by-passes them.
Sentence 5:  10.24550072534126 
2443.
Sentence 6: the point  is that many of the most impressive developments in the 
arts nowadays  are aberrant idiosyncratic.
Sentence 7: 10.257535314367495 
2444.
Sentence 8: there is no longer any sense of continuing  development of the 
sort that can be traced from baudelaire to  eluard or for that matter 
from hawthorne through henry james to  gertrude stein.
  12.048875494013984 
2445.
Sentence 9: the cubist generation before world war 1 and on a lower level the 
surrealists of the period between the wars both  assumed an accepted 
universe of discourse in which to quote andre  breton it was possible 
to make definite advances exactly as in the  sciences.
Sentence 10:  5.665444369780576 
2446.
Sentence 11: i doubt if anyone holds such ideas today.
Sentence 12:  14.345191843103729 
2447.
Sentence 13: continuity exits but like the neo-swing music developed from lester 
young it is a continuity sustained by popular demand.
Sentence 14:  5.236383152695367 
2448.
Sentence 15: in the plastic arts  a very similar situation exists.
  14.472504058424475 
2449.
Sentence 16: surrealists like hans arp and max ernst might talk of creation by 
hazard- of composing pictures by  walking on them with painted soles or 
by tossing bits of paper up in  the air.
Sentence 17:  4.595688357851942 
2450.
Sentence 18: but it is obvious that they were self-deluded.
Sentence 19:  28.20498113366533 
2451.
Sentence 20: nothing looks  anything like an ernst or an arp but another ernst 
or arp.
Sentence 21:  6.18936217805711 
2452.
Sentence 22: nothing  looks less like their work than the happenings of random 
occasion.
Sentence 23:  7.615092762846159 
2453.
Sentence 24: many of the post-world war 2 abstract expressionists apostles  of 
the discipline of spontaneity and hazard look alike and do lo ok  like 
accidents.
Sentence 25: 7.170510863581735 
2454.
Sentence 26: the aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random  may exist 
but it is a very impoverished appeal.
Sentence 27:  9.605882008963722 
2455.
Sentence 28: once again what has  happened is an all-consuming confabulation of 
the incidentals the accidents  of painting.
Sentence 29:  7.047649767324945 
2456.
Sentence 30: it is curious that at its best the work of this  school of 
painting- mark rothko jackson pollock clyfford still  robert motherwell 
willem de-kooning and the rest- resembles  nothing so much as the 
passage painting of quite unimpressive painters:  the mother- of-pearl 
shimmer in the background of a henry mcfee  itself a formula derived 
from renoir; the splashes of light and black which fake drapery in the 
fashionable imitators of hals and sargent.
Sentence 31:  6.864033054103141 
2457.
Sentence 32: often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy- the pure
  utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque 
values.
Sentence 33:  6.48518912235855 
2458.
Sentence 34: you have only to compare such painting with the work of say
  sesshu to realize that someone is using words and brushes 
carelessly.
Sentence 35: 9.979619857777196 
2459.
Sentence 36: at its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo
  decorative surface.
Sentence 37:  8.444373836556068 
2460.
Sentence 38: its poverty shows up immediately when compared  with tiepolo 
where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity  and 
power.
Sentence 39:  6.885845530166437 
2461.
Sentence 40: a tiepolo painting however confabulated is a universe of tensions 
in vast depths.
Sentence 41:  6.62197242591231 
2462.
Sentence 42: a pollock is an object of art-  bijouterie- disguised only by its 
great size.
Sentence 43: 8.121134903484508 
2463.
Sentence 44: in fact once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall it turns 
into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper.
Sentence 45:  6.779142684935131 
Sentence 1: 2464.
Sentence 2: now there is nothing wrong with complicated  wallpaper.
  19.861570628781667 
2465.
Sentence 3: there is just more to tiepolo.
Sentence 4:  20.465764338977046 
2466.
Sentence 5: the great ashikaga  brush painters painted wallpapers too- at 
least portable ones  screens.
Sentence 6:  9.69584296187422 
2467.
Sentence 7: a process of elimination which leaves the artist with  nothing but 
the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest  in either 
artist or public for very long.
Sentence 8:  5.3830541283342495 
2468.
Sentence 9: so in the last couple of years abstract expressionism has tended 
toward romantic suggestion- indications of landscape or living figures.
  10.011989724463431 
2469.
Sentence 10: anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasions  a 
seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age.
  5.2316497178608055 
2470.
Sentence 11: hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at finnsburg  and 
improvises the tale of beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison 
of the geatish visitor with sigemund  ; alcinou^s' court bard sings of 
the discovered adultery  of ares and aphrodite and takes up  a 
tale of odysseus while the ithacan wanderer listens on  .
  5.489183308742081 
2471.
Sentence 12: nothing in all this is autobiographical: unlike  the poets of deor 
and widsith the poet of beowulf is  not concerned with his own 
identity; the poet of the odyssey reputed blind reveals himself not at 
all in singing of the blind minstrel  demodocus.
Sentence 13: 6.107347697335239 
2472.
Sentence 14: since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing  is 
intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter there  is 
prima-facie evidence that beowulf and the homeric poems each  derive from 
an oral tradition.
Sentence 15:  6.376972665209586 
2473.
Sentence 16: that such a tradition lies behind the iliad and the odyssey at 
least is hard to deny.
Sentence 17: 7.496353765918881 
2474.
Sentence 18: milman  parry rigorously defended the observation that the 
extant homeric  poems are largely formulaic and was led to postulate 
that they could  be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of 
greek epic survived;  he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic 
verse indicate  oral composition and assumed the slightly less likely 
corollary  that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas.
  5.525658946227611 
2475.
Sentence 19: proceeding from parry's conclusions and adopting one of his 
schemata francis p  magoun jr argues that beowulf likewise was created 
from  a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of 
successive generations and the thesis is striking and compelling.
  4.5840097891606915 
2476.
Sentence 20: yet a fresh  inspection will indicate one crucial amendment: 
beowulf and the homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent.
  9.512129793534319 
2477.
Sentence 21: the bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a
  very skilful oral poet but it appears safe to assume that no 
sustained  narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme 
difficulty even  in a language of many terminal inflections.
  5.126978866115259 
2478.
Sentence 22: assonance seems nearly as severe a curb although in a celebrated 
passage william of malmesbury  declares that a song of roland was 
intoned before the battle  commenced at hastings.
Sentence 23: 6.064510266373365 
2479.
Sentence 24: the anglo-saxon alliterative line and the  homeric hexameter 
probably imposed less of a restraint; the verse  of beowulf or of the 
iliad and the odyssey was not easy  to create but was not impossible 
for poets who had developed their talents  perforce in earning a 
livelihood.
Sentence 25: 4.995286883288707 
2480.
Sentence 26: yet certain aids were valuable  and quite credibly necessary for 
reciting long stretches of verse without  a pause.
Sentence 27:  7.860440992708896 
Sentence 1: 2481.
Sentence 2: the poet in a written tradition who generally never blots  a 
line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame.
  5.401704351336071 
2482.
Sentence 3: but the oral poet cannot pause; he must improvise continuously
  with no apparent effort.
Sentence 4:  10.07298030171053 
2483.
Sentence 5: even though the bondage of his verse is not  so great as the 
writing poet can manage it is still great enough for  him often to be 
seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition.
  5.631693305072454 
2484.
Sentence 6: the germanic poet had such aids in the kennings which  provided 
for the difficulties of alliteration; the homeric poet  had epithets 
which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter.
Sentence 7:  6.92244967757774 
2485.
Sentence 8: either  poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to 
supply  his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines because 
the kennings  and the epithets made possible the construction of 
systems of numerous  synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns.
  4.7586405289825215 
2486.
Sentence 9: other synonyms  could of course serve the same function and for 
the sake of ease i  shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest 
and loosest poss1ble  sense and name for example gar-dene a kenning for 
the danes.
Sentence 10: 6.612118413818551 
2487.
Sentence 11: verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction
  but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and
  adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents and to designate the
  members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the 
poetic  language.
Sentence 12:  4.995698215649711 
2488.
Sentence 13: limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in anglo-saxon
  as in the other germanic dialects we cannot say how frequently
  the kennings in beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same
  soil.
Sentence 14: 6.587538010456491 
2489.
Sentence 15: but we can say that since a writing poet with leisure before him 
would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and
  substantial circumlocution the kennings like the epithets must 
reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition.
Sentence 16: 5.683519988500159 
2490.
Sentence 17: one of the greatest  homerists of our time frederick m combellack 
argues that when it is assumed the iliad and the odyssey are oral poems 
the  postulated single redactor called homer cannot be either credited 
with  or denied originality in choice of phrasing.
Sentence 18: 7.654115508483899 
2491.
Sentence 19: any example of grand  or exquisite diction may have been created by 
the poet who compiled numerous  lays into the two works we possess or 
may be due to one of his  completely unknown fellow-craftsmen.
  6.0576201673376495 
2492.
Sentence 20: the quest of the historical homer is likely never to have further 
success; no individual word in the  iliad or the odyssey can be 
credited to any one man; no strikingly effective element of speech in 
the extant poems can with assurance  be said not to have been a 
commonplace in the vaster epic corpus  that may have existed at the 
beginning of the first millennium before  christ.
Sentence 21:  6.56751093092572 
2493.
Sentence 22: this observation is of interest not only to students of homeric
  poetry but to students of anglo-saxon poetry as well.
  6.278496010275255 
2494.
Sentence 23: to the  extent that a tale is twice told its final author must 
be suspect although  plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a 
misdemeanor than the  standard modus dicendi.
Sentence 24:  6.489845441307498 
2495.
Sentence 25: combellack argues further and here  he makes his main point that 
once the iliad and the odyssey  are thought formulaic poems composed 
for an audience accustomed to  formulaic poetry homeric critics are 
deprived of an entire domain they previously found arable.
  4.528081680082931 
Sentence 1: 2496.
Sentence 2: with a few important and a few more unimportant  exceptions no 
expression can be deemed le mot juste for its  context because each 
was very probably the only expression that long-established  practice 
and ease of rapid recitation would allow.
Sentence 3:  6.930284920411557 
2497.
Sentence 4: words or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or 
ironic or  humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere 
inevitable time-servers sometimes accurate and sometimes not.
  4.726707772215755 
2498.
Sentence 5: this observation too may have reference to anglo-saxon poetry.
  10.867675364171879 
2499.
Sentence 6: to the extent that  a language is formulaic its individual 
components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other cliches.
  6.800485980416366 
2500.
Sentence 7: w f bryan  suggests that certain kennings in beowulf were selected 
sometimes  for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness 
but  such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the 
language  of beowulf is formulaic.
Sentence 8:  5.770010445349895 
2501.
Sentence 9: if the master of scops who was most  responsible for the poem 
ever used kennings that were traditional he  was at least partly deprived 
of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of 
speech elements.
Sentence 10: 5.459820631062979 
2502.
Sentence 11: once many significant phrases are found in theory or in recurrent 
practice to provide for  prosodic necessity they are not to be 
defended for their semantic properties in isolated contexts.
  8.225325923752079 
2503.
Sentence 12: it is false to be certain of having discovered  in the language 
of beowulf such effects as intentional irony.
Sentence 13:  8.826774142520293 
2504.
Sentence 14: yet if the argument is turned awry there may be found a great deal 
in bryan's view after all.
Sentence 15:  8.150375262010103 
2505.
Sentence 16: a formulaic element need not  be held meaningless merely 
because it was selected with little conscious  reflection.
  6.753689599301928 
2506.
Sentence 17: time-servers though the periphrastic expressions are  they may 
nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous.
Sentence 18:  7.032105024464237 
2507.
Sentence 19: a long evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of 
the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important 
qualities of things  and these formulas are therefore potentially 
rather than always actually accurate.
Sentence 20:  5.28418895858997 
2508.
Sentence 21: true we do not know how they were regarded in their  day but we 
need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive  to 
the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who  have read 
germanic or homeric poetry all their lives and still found  much to 
admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases.
  7.244939295888758 
2509.
Sentence 22: nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the 
nonce;  in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic 
corpus  and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive 
delineation.
Sentence 23:  4.8778618439062065 
2510.
Sentence 24: reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological 
particulars in an oral poem; no-one today would hope to discover the 
unmistakable  ruins of heorot or the palace of priam.
Sentence 25: 6.435369987839622 
2511.
Sentence 26: a ship at dry-dock  could be called a foamy-necked floater in 
anglo-saxon or a swift ship in greek.
Sentence 27:  6.133266541338854 
2512.
Sentence 28: even when defenseless of weapons the danes would be  gar-dene 
and priam would be |e|u|m|m|e|l|i|h|s.
Sentence 29: 9.251300480935768 
2513.
Sentence 30: achilles like siegfried in the nibelungenlied  is potentially 
the swiftest of men and may accordingly be called swift-footed even when 
he stands idle.
Sentence 31:  5.176194017828768 
2514.
Sentence 32: in coriolanus  the agnomen of marcius is used deliberately and 
pointedly but the homeric epithets and the anglo-saxon kennings are 
Sentence 1: used casually and  recall to the hearer a familiar story or situation 
or a useful or  pleasant quality of the referent.
Sentence 2: 6.511591977304625 
2515.
Sentence 3: the epic language was not entirely  the servant of the poet; it 
was partly his master.
Sentence 4: 6.196120048044738 
2516.
Sentence 5: the poet's intentions are difficult to discern and except to 
biographers unimportant;  the language however is a proper object of 
scrutiny and the effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes 
inevitable.
Sentence 6: 6.806519214711211 
2517.
Sentence 7: beowulf and the homeric poems appear oral compositions.
  6.764147616291221 
2518.
Sentence 8: yet  they are written; at some stage in their evolution they were 
transcribed.
Sentence 9:  7.551142963309131 
2519.
Sentence 10: albert b lord suggests that the homeric poems were dictated  to a 
scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured  but 
did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it  would  be 
useless to his guild and magoun argues that the beowulf poet and cynewulf 
may have dictated their verse in the same fashion.
Sentence 11: 4.764968979983582 
2520.
Sentence 12: this explanation is attractive but is vitiated at least in part by
  the observation that cynewulf though he used kennings in the 
traditional manner was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by 
runes into his works.
Sentence 13:  6.961063126158051 
2521.
Sentence 14: if cynewulf was literate the beowulf poet  may have been also and 
so may the final redactor of the iliad and  the odyssey.
  5.83870492964239 
2522.
Sentence 15: in lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate  bard one 
may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry  recited and 
became intimately familiar with the established aids  to poetizing and 
himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of  the compositions 
of the past.
Sentence 16:  6.785017561187208 
2523.
Sentence 17: other theories of origin are compatible  with the formulaic 
theory: beowulf may contain a design for  terror and the iliad may 
have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering  to a ceramic pattern 
produced during the geometric period in pottery.
Sentence 18:  4.850102344993435 
2524.
Sentence 19: the account of the growth and final transcription of these  epics 
rests partly however upon the degree to which they were formulaic.
  9.509584365532179 
2525.
Sentence 20: carl eduard schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated
  exactly in the two homeric poems and by increasing this figure so
  as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he 
counted  2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times.
  4.79231489244203 
2526.
Sentence 21: thus one line in five from the iliad and the odyssey is to be found 
somewhere  else in the two poems.
Sentence 22: 9.78255484886359 
2527.
Sentence 23: the ratio is thoroughly remarkable because the  lines are so 
long- half again as long as those of beowulf.
Sentence 24:  6.78142434277876 
2528.
Sentence 25: anglo-saxon  poetry appears to have no comparable amount of 
repetition; there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used 
whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his homeric 
colleague.
Sentence 26: 7.950849111100524 
2529.
Sentence 27: in determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle
  however to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety
  for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the 
poet  to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs.
  5.435650160094619 
2530.
Sentence 28: the closest scrutiny is owed to the anglo-saxon kennings and the 
homeric  epithets; if any words or phrases are formulaic they will be.
  6.852952259467768 
2531.
Sentence 29: the iliad has two words for the shield |a|s|p|i|s and |s|a|k|o|s.
  7.43304005989246 
Sentence 1: 2532.
Sentence 2: recent criticism of great expectations has tended to emphasize
  its symbolic and mythic content to show as m d zabel has said of 
dickens generally that much of the novel's impact resides  in its 
allegoric insight and moral metaphor.
Sentence 3:  6.629735056239761 
2533.
Sentence 4: j h miller's  excellent chapter on great expectations has lately 
illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective.
  5.24335413163277 
2534.
Sentence 5: in his analysis however he touches upon but fails to explore an 
idea  generally neglected in discussions of the book which i believe is
  central to its art- the importance of human hands as a recurring 
feature  of the narrative.
Sentence 6:  6.990891126165973 
2535.
Sentence 7: this essay seeks to make that exploration.
Sentence 8:  11.111637260897332 
2536.
Sentence 9: dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great 
victorian  writers.
Sentence 10:  7.9212783525028 
2537.
Sentence 11: he knew instinctively that next to voice and face an  actor's 
hands are his most useful possession- that in fiction as in the theatre 
gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing  character 
and dramatizing action and response.
Sentence 12:  5.25066009146314 
2538.
Sentence 13: it is hardly accidental  therefore that many of his most vivid 
figures do suggestive or  eccentric things with their hands.
  12.133349405580867 
2539.
Sentence 14: in great expectations the hands  become almost an obsession.
  9.331389223331769 
2540.
Sentence 15: mr jaggers habitually bites his  forefinger a gesture which 
conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half 
fascinates half terrifies all who have dealings with him.
  6.574231878500228 
2541.
Sentence 16: miss havisham's withered hands heavy as if her unhappiness were
  somehow concentrated in them move in restless self-pity between her
  broken heart and her walking stick.
Sentence 17:  5.0773330825786385 
2542.
Sentence 18: pumblechook's signature  is the perpetually extended glad hand.
  9.060328853487057 
2543.
Sentence 19: wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction  by regularly rubbing his 
hands together.
Sentence 20:  6.460370037324521 
2544.
Sentence 21: old mr pocket's frantic response to life imprisonment with a 
useless social-climbing  wife is to put his two hands into his 
disturbed hair and make  an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by 
it whereas joe gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of mrs joe by 
apologetically  drawing the back of his hand across and across his nose.
  5.94763554170693 
2545.
Sentence 22: such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark were it  not that in 
great expectations as in no other of dickens' nove ls  hands serve as a 
leitmotif of plot and theme- a kind of unifying  symbol or natural 
metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships  and the 
values and attitudes that motivate them.
Sentence 23:  4.852760853751759 
2546.
Sentence 24: dickens  not only reveals character through gesture he makes 
hands a crucial  element of the plot a means of clarifying the structure 
of the novel  by helping to define the hero's relations with all the 
major characters and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt 
pursuit  crime greed education materialism enslavement  friendship 
romantic love forgiveness and redemption.
Sentence 25:  6.165388617048782 
2547.
Sentence 26: we have only to think of lady macbeth or the policeman-murderer
  in thomas burke's famous story the hands of mr ottermole to realize 
that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment.
Sentence 27: 6.34576232335543 
2548.
Sentence 28: so it is with great expectations whether the hands be  orlick's
  as he strikes down mrs gargery or pip's as he steals a  pie from 
her pantry.
Sentence 29: 7.823881790210865 
2549.
Sentence 30: such associations suit well with the gothic or  mystery-story 
aspects of dickens' novel but on a deeper plane they  relate to the 
Sentence 1: themes of sin guilt and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other 
critics.
Sentence 2:  4.921988208937112 
2550.
Sentence 3: the novel opens with a fugitive  convict frantically trying to 
avoid the nemesis of being laid hands on- a mysterious figure who looks 
into pip's frightened eyes in the churchyard as if he were eluding the 
hands of the dead  people stretching up cautiously out of their 
graves to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in.
  7.0665601113159004 
2551.
Sentence 4: magwitch terrifies pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating 
the image in the boy's imagination  of a bogy man who may softly 
creep h his way to him and tear  him open in him.
Sentence 5: 5.190153937133001 
2552.
Sentence 6: as pip agonizes over the theft that his own hands have committed 
his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local 
signpost transforming it into a phantom devoting me to the hulks.
  6.9652890256336715 
2553.
Sentence 7: held upside down in the graveyard pip clings in terror with both 
hands to his convict; later he flees in panic from the family table just 
as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the  front door 
by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which  he 
has brought to gargery's forge for mending.
Sentence 8:  4.785847838346531 
2554.
Sentence 9: through such details  dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is 
a part of the ironic  bond between pip and magwitch which is so 
unpredictably to alter both their lives.
Sentence 10:  8.868133355665853 
2555.
Sentence 11: since they commonly translate thoughts and  feelings into deeds 
hands naturally represent action and since nearly  half the characters in 
great expectations are of the underworld  or closely allied to it the 
linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at.
  5.169149522281497 
2556.
Sentence 12: dickens for excellent psychological reasons  never fully reveals 
magwitch's felonious past but pip at the  convict's climactic 
reappearance in london shrinks from clasping a hand which he fears might 
be stained with blood.
Sentence 13: 5.830388127029086 
2557.
Sentence 14: orlick  slouches about the forge like cain with his hands in his 
pockets  and when he shouts abuse at mrs joe for objecting  to his 
holiday she claps her hands in a tantrum beats them upon her  bosom and 
upon her knees and clenches them in her husband's  hair.
Sentence 15: 4.553092154645561 
2558.
Sentence 16: this last rampage is only the prelude to the vicious  blow upon 
her head dealt by some unknown hand whose identity is later revealed not 
verbally but through a manual action- the tracing  of orlick's hammer 
upon a slate.
Sentence 17:  6.454169805465994 
2559.
Sentence 18: pip himself is to feel the  terror of orlick's murderous hand in 
his secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on the marshes.
  5.083242045036259 
2560.
Sentence 19: dickens lays great emphasis on  the hands in this scene.
  8.196044167676531 
2561.
Sentence 20: orlick shakes his hand at pip bangs the table  with his fist 
draws his unclenched hand across his mouth as if  his mouth watered for 
his victim lets his hands hang loose and  heavy at his sides and pip 
observes him so intensely that he knows of the slightest action of his 
fingers.
Sentence 21:  4.2611486463056485 
2562.
Sentence 22: orlick might almost  be magwitch's bogy man come alive a figure of 
nemesis from pip's  phantasy of guilt.
Sentence 23:  7.086474546528567 
2563.
Sentence 24: the scarred disfigured wrists of mr  jaggers' housekeeper are the 
tell-tale marks of her sinister  past for her master coolly exhibiting 
them to his dinner guests makes  a point of the force of grip there is 
in these hands.
Sentence 25:  5.400391395101165 
2564.
Sentence 26: jaggers'  iron control over her any dish she put before him 
hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling  rests on his having once got 
her acquitted  of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at 
the trial to  conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations 
Sentence 1: on the backs  of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of 
human fingernails.
Sentence 2:  5.440067206524194 
2565.
Sentence 3: it is the similarity between estella's hands and molly's  that 
provides pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and
  establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime 
and  the genteel cruelty of satis house.
Sentence 4:  6.313363151106085 
2566.
Sentence 5: finally magwitch's pursuit  of compeyson his archenemy and betrayer 
begins by his holding him  in a vicelike grip on the river flats to 
frustrate his escape and culminates  in his laying his hand on his 
cloak to identify him thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in 
the water during which compeyson drowns.
Sentence 6: 0.0 
2567.
Sentence 7: magwitch's hand here ironically becomes the agent of justice.
  6.764147616291221 
2568.
Sentence 8: but only in one of its aspects is great expectations  a tale of 
violence revenge and retribution.
Sentence 9: 11.433813223815921 
2569.
Sentence 10: money so  important a theme elsewhere in dickens is here central 
and hands are  often associated in some way with the false values- 
acquisitiveness  snobbery self-interest hypocrisy toadyism 
irresponsibility injustice- that attach to a society based upon the 
pursuit of wealth.
Sentence 11:  4.996985353265486 
2570.
Sentence 12: dickens suggests the economic evils of such a society on the first

2799.
Sentence 35: then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements  can be channeled 
to produce cumulative progress toward a common  objective.
  6.361462262301334 
2800.
Sentence 36: an over-all concept would have other advantages.
  10.477725297338463 
2801.
Sentence 37: it would  allow presentation to the public of a unified approach.
  10.368684421273127 
2802.
Sentence 38: now the problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes 
contradictorily.
Sentence 39: 12.152571981005552 
Sentence 1: 2803.
Sentence 2: while one  element  is announcing progress another is delineating 
its problems.
Sentence 3:  7.321972785933993 
2804.
Sentence 4: the  result can only be confusion in the public mind.
  10.824033822709982 
2805.
Sentence 5: a unified concept  can serve as a guide to budgeting and if 
public support is gained will  command congressional support.
  6.130963165601821 
2806.
Sentence 6: industry's main criticism of the navy's antisubmarine effort is 
that it cannot determine where any  one company or industry can apply 
its skills and know-how.
Sentence 7:  7.352561550041772 
2807.
Sentence 8: lacking guidance industry picks its own areas.
Sentence 9:  8.762426024314411 
2808.
Sentence 10: the result coupled with the salesmanship  for which american 
industry is famous is considerable expenditure  of funds and efforts 
in marginal areas.
Sentence 11:  8.506140216384392 
2809.
Sentence 12: an over-all concept  will guide industry where available talents 
and facilities will yield  greatest dividends.
Sentence 13:  6.2338487675332335 
2810.
Sentence 14: therefore a broad concept of over-all submarine  defense is needed 
for co-ordination of the navy's efforts for a logical  presentation to 
the public for industry's guidance and as a  basis for a program to the 
congress.
Sentence 15:  6.637234384017638 
2811.
Sentence 16: concept  that which follows will be a discussion of principles
  and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine 
warfare.
Sentence 17:  6.109491189080505 
2812.
Sentence 18: russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world 
divided  between her various fleets.
Sentence 19: 10.042467815380848 
2813.
Sentence 20: some are also in albania and others  are on loan to egypt.
  7.583775777699051 
2814.
Sentence 21: other countries which may willingly or unwillingly become communist 
can furnish bases.
Sentence 22:  8.26207590452333 
2815.
Sentence 23: communist target areas can  be assumed but there is no certainty 
that such assumptions coincide  with soviet intentions.
  7.370310609769442 
2816.
Sentence 24: attack can come from almost any direction against many locations.
  8.196044167676531 
2817.
Sentence 25: logically then the first principle of the plan  must be that it 
is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area.
Sentence 26:  6.646515052475208 
2818.
Sentence 27: it is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while
  building at bases in transit and on station.
Sentence 28: 9.995396910362448 
2819.
Sentence 29: destruction of the enemy's  building and base complex however 
requires attacks on enemy  territory which is possible only in event of 
all-out hostilities.
Sentence 30:  5.693578257441505 
2820.
Sentence 31: in  transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the 
submarines until commission of an overt act.
Sentence 32: 8.02021381973691 
2821.
Sentence 33: the communists are adept at utilizing  hostilities short of general 
war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage.
Sentence 34:  6.49989374794633 
2822.
Sentence 35: therefore the second principle of the plan must be that while 
providing for all-out hostilities its effectiveness is  not dependent on 
general war.
Sentence 36:  7.262176264192017 
2823.
Sentence 37: antisubmarine warfare does not involve clashes between large 
opposing forces with the decision a result  of a single battle.
  5.236383152695367 
2824.
Sentence 38: it is a war of attrition of single actions  of an exchange of 
losses.
Sentence 39:  15.861792798818417 
2825.
Sentence 40: this exchange must result in our ending up  with some effective 
units.
Sentence 41:  7.250862165373997 
2826.
Sentence 42: initially having fewer units of some elements-  especially 
submarines- than the opponent our capabilities need  to be 
sufficiently greater than theirs so that the exchange will  be in our 
favor.
Sentence 43:  6.352388959314798 
Sentence 1: 2827.
Sentence 2: therefore the third principle of the plan must be that  it does not 
depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types unless at an 
assured favorable exchange rate.
Sentence 3:  5.719195656854624 
2828.
Sentence 4: the submarine  has increased its effectiveness by several orders 
of magnitude since  world war 2.
Sentence 5:  8.346523409839932 
2829.
Sentence 6: its speed has increased it operates at increasingly  greater 
depths its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited and it will become 
even more silent.
Sentence 7:  5.18742509826831 
2830.
Sentence 8: the next developments will probably  be in weaponry.
  13.314096035204095 
2831.
Sentence 9: the missile can gradually be expected to replace the  torpedo.
  9.204644232367036 
2832.
Sentence 10: as detection ranges increase weapons will be developed to
  attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges.
  8.197482826165501 
2833.
Sentence 11: therefore  the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide 
for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent.
  6.159638137837797 
2834.
Sentence 12: no element can accomplish  the total objective of submarine 
defense.
Sentence 13:  9.76376045036682 
2835.
Sentence 14: some elements support the others but all have limitations.
  8.592800318346152 
2836.
Sentence 15: some limitations of one element  can be compensated for by a 
capability of another.
Sentence 16: 8.114131125286105 
2837.
Sentence 17: elements used  in combination will increase the over-all 
capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual 
elements.
Sentence 18:  6.325311163473002 
2838.
Sentence 19: therefore the plan's  fifth principle must be that it capitalize on 
the capabilities of  all elements in combination.
Sentence 20: 7.476488229392695 
2839.
Sentence 21: conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solved by 
sufficient forces.
Sentence 22:  6.210871206873012 
2840.
Sentence 23: numbers would be astronomical  and current fiscal policies make 
this an impractical solution.
Sentence 24:  7.391013650626644 
2841.
Sentence 25: shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon programs indicate that
  there will not be enough of anything.
Sentence 26:  6.066941276481856 
2842.
Sentence 27: therefore any measures taken  in peacetime which will decrease 
force requirements in war will contribute  greatly to success when 
hostilities occur.
Sentence 28:  6.748802289035621 
2843.
Sentence 29: therefore the sixth  principle of the plan must be that it 
concentrate on current measures  which will reduce future force 
requirements.
Sentence 30:  5.689166266815458 
2844.
Sentence 31: the world is constantly  changing; what was new yesterday is 
obsolescent today.
Sentence 32:  12.321059980898383 
2845.
Sentence 33: the  seventh principle of the plan is self-evident; it must be 
flexible enough  to allow for technological breakthroughs scientific 
progress and  changes in world conditions.
Sentence 34: 5.989795157616825 
2846.
Sentence 35: to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense
  has been demonstrated the mission has been stated broad principles
  delineating its content laid down and the supporting elements 
listed.
Sentence 36:  7.369551939108993 
2847.
Sentence 37: before considering these elements in more detail an additional
  requirement should be stated.
Sentence 38:  6.791049676473546 
2848.
Sentence 39: large area coverage will accomplish all  other tasks.
  9.30371038265301 
2849.
Sentence 40: therefore because reduction in tasks results in reduction  of 
forces required the plan should provide for expanding area coverage.
  5.406664019112 
2850.
Sentence 41: but it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented
  geographically.
Sentence 42:  16.794073807785615 
Sentence 1: 2851.
Sentence 2: consequently the system giving area coverage must be flexible and 
hence at least  partially mobile.
Sentence 3:  5.725106139771221 
2852.
Sentence 4: since effective area coverage appears fairly remote  the 
requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements:  air 
surface sub-surface fixed installations mines and intelligence.
  6.6384731410985784 
2853.
Sentence 5: these are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness
  of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order
  in the hope that the true order of importance will result.
  7.873299667697262 
2854.
Sentence 6: intelligence  as used herein will include information on 
possible  opponents and on the environment which can affect operations.
  7.519188723481248 
2855.
Sentence 7: these can  be referred to as operational intelligence and 
environmental intelligence.
Sentence 8: 8.010081924658726 
2856.
Sentence 9: in submarine defense these must have maximum stress.
  11.838405196350237 
2857.
Sentence 10: good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning greatly 
reduce force  requirements  and increase tactical effectiveness.
  6.302470714181657 
2858.
Sentence 11: environmental intelligence  is just as important.
  10.472119682746735 
2859.
Sentence 12: the ocean presently co-operates with the  target.
  9.802060557618772 
2860.
Sentence 13: full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the
  environment to our side resulting in an increase in effectiveness 
of  equipment and tactics a decrease in enemy capabilities and the 
development of methods of capitalizing on the environment.
  6.343712616334543 
2861.
Sentence 14: therefore improved  intelligence will result in reduced force 
requirements and as  it supports all other elements rates a top 
priority.
Sentence 15:  5.406664019112 
2862.
Sentence 16: gathering intelligence is important but of equal importance is its 
translation into usable form.
Sentence 17:  7.391013650626644 
2863.
Sentence 18: a program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic
  research into tactical and operating instructions.
Sentence 19: 7.17999136448753 
2864.
Sentence 20: approaching  this problem on a statistical basis is invalid 
because the opponent  has the same sources available and will be 
encountered not under average conditions but under the conditions most 
advantageous to him.
Sentence 21:  6.3268751469330775 
2865.
Sentence 22: therefore the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating
  instructions based on measurement of conditions in the area at the 
time  of encounter.
Sentence 23:  5.801816149505095 
2866.
Sentence 24: all capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then.
  12.548120470661539 
2867.
Sentence 25: temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and
  animal life are the chief environmental variables.
Sentence 26: 5.90870224590401 
2868.
Sentence 27: variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than 
temperature because more of the variables would be encompassed.
  7.357756497138044 
2869.
Sentence 28: these variations must eventually be measured horizontally as well 
as vertically.
Sentence 29:  8.40276774381342 
2870.
Sentence 30: progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging but little
  guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such 
information.
Sentence 31:  9.928013458050904 
2871.
Sentence 32: a concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on
  the spot.
Sentence 33:  6.62197242591231 
2872.
Sentence 34: mine warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets.
  9.151803601223891 
Sentence 1: 2873.
Sentence 2: by its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage 
and small efforts have required considerably greater  counter-efforts.
  6.357213028433671 
2874.
Sentence 3: mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets.
  9.060328853487057 
2875.
Sentence 4: they are still considered to be for use in restricted waters
  however and targets must come within a few yards of them.
  8.350340367640717 
2876.
Sentence 5: mines need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine 
warfare employment  extended to deep water and have their effective 
area per unit  increased.
Sentence 6: 6.38769540514313 
2877.
Sentence 7: mines can be used to deny access to great areas; they  are 
difficult to counter cost little to maintain until required and  can 
be put into place quickly.
Sentence 8:  5.790072726947081 
2878.
Sentence 9: a most attractive feature is that detection  and attack are 
combined in a single package.
Sentence 10:  8.405340457262655 
2879.
Sentence 11: effective employment  will reduce force requirements.
  8.254441635698543 
2880.
Sentence 12: for example effective mine  barriers from florida to cuba and 
across the yucatan channel from  cuba to mexico would remove all 
requirements for harbor defense  inshore patrol convoy escort shipping 
control and mine defense for the entire gulf of mexico.
Sentence 13:  6.894498875494615 
2881.
Sentence 14: more extended systems covering all passage  into the caribbean 
would free the caribbean and the gulf of mexico  from the previously 
listed requirements.
Sentence 15:  5.563375759127216 
2882.
Sentence 16: systems covering the gulf  of st lawrence and possibly the entire 
coasts of the united  states are not impossible.
Sentence 17:  6.85267062431164 
2883.
Sentence 18: such mine defense systems could permit concentration  of mobile 
forces in the open oceans with consequent increase in the probability of 
success.
Sentence 19:  6.92578822529471 
2884.
Sentence 20: the advantages inherent in mine warfare  justify as great an 
importance for this element as is accorded any  of the other elements.
  7.068970569960655 
2885.
Sentence 21: fixed installations are increasingly  advocated as the problem of 
area defense emerges.
Sentence 22: 6.771690794857863 
2886.
Sentence 23: the proponents  are scientific and technical men who exercise 
considerable influence on their military counterparts.
Sentence 24:  8.346523409839932 
2887.
Sentence 25: systems which detect submarines over  wide areas are attractive 
although they can be only burglar alarms.
Sentence 26:  5.967602403211639 
2888.
Sentence 27: mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets
  since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target.
  7.39383563555266 
2889.
Sentence 28: such systems  are expensive and are oriented geographically.
  8.771033092947984 
2890.
Sentence 29: in an over-all  asw concept dependence on and effort expended for 
such systems  should be limited to those with proven capabilities.
  9.227902432166399 
2891.
Sentence 30: no general installation  should be made until a model 
installation has been proved and  its maximum capability determined.
  6.1207706529024115 
2892.
Sentence 31: in addition proposals for fixed installations  should be 
carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile  system.
  10.757927046801495 
2893.
Sentence 32: for fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that
  should be inherent in naval systems.
Sentence 33:  6.576251425143321 
2894.
Sentence 34: the submarine has become increasingly attractive as an 
antisubmarine weapon system.
Sentence 35: 9.430036403335416 
2895.
Sentence 36: it operates  in its target's environment and any advantage 
gained therefrom by the target is shared by the attacker.
  7.724715166504337 
Sentence 1: 2896.
Sentence 2: but the submarine is a weapon  of ambush and therefore always in 
danger of being ambushed.
Sentence 3:  9.742935294239802 
2897.
Sentence 4: two metabolites which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of 
aniline by acid-fast  bacteria are biosynthesized from paba.
  5.788801185383924 
2898.
Sentence 5: the 7 carbons of paba are incorporated directly into metabolite 2
  .
Sentence 6:  9.430036403335416 
2899.
Sentence 7: thirty-five of the 36 carbon atoms arise from paba.
  6.764147616291221 
2900.
Sentence 8: all 28 carbons of metabolite 1  arise from paba.
  10.566937912973131 
2901.
Sentence 9: metabolite 1 isolated from the medium however showed a lower 
specific  activity which indicates endogenous synthesis of this 
metabolite.
Sentence 10: 5.15576524365156 
2902.
Sentence 11: vigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 destroyed the  biological 
activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines.
Sentence 12: 6.643215071337043 
2903.
Sentence 13: fragment a has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate 
salt  and free base.

2905.
Sentence 17: h sloane; chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation
  - research on esterases in mammalian sera was continued.
  5.714421194550266 
2906.
Sentence 18: one of the most interesting findings was the extreme sensitivity of 
plasma arylesterases to  rare earth ions.
Sentence 19: 12.941462857514958 
2907.
Sentence 20: the inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations  of 
lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect  of 
rare earth salts.
Sentence 21:  5.71098065430772 
2908.
Sentence 22: various metal ions have been found to protect plasma
  arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine.

2910.
Sentence 25: the non-identity of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also 
established.
Sentence 26:  9.005093323721033 
2911.
Sentence 27: furthermore the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied in mammalian
  sera and it was found that it is hydrolyzed by albumin  in addition 
to arylesterase.
Sentence 28: 6.134739308693741

2919.
Sentence 42: substance z an active urinary  peptide was purified by 
extraction in organic solvents and repeated  column chromatography; high-
voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography  were used in 
preliminary structural studies; pharmacological  effects in vitro on 
isolated surviving organs and in vivo  on blood pressure were assayed; 
special equipment required for registering  respiration and for 
recording the contraction of smooth muscles  under various conditions was 
developed by the instruments section  ; and enzymes  which terminate 
Sentence 1: the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps  substance z were 
studied.

require extremely heavy doses of 10 mrad  or mor e.
Sentence 8:  5.326519577128725 
3124.
Sentence 9: because of undesirable flavors odors colors and generally  low 
palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude the 
inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation  by 
the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching.
Sentence 10:  7.099659194319115 
3125.
Sentence 11: radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food.

Sentence 25: preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable 
side  effects particularly at the higher radiation dosages.
  5.326519577128725 
3134.
Sentence 26: in this respect the general palatability and individual acceptance 
of most radiosterilized  foods has to date been found to be low in 
comparison with  fresh and commercially processed foods.
Sentence 27: 7.593689736903686 
3135.
Sentence 28: a number of foods are quite acceptable as regards taste and

sterilization levels.
Sentence 29: 7.123467306335329 
3136.
Sentence 30: moreover the nutritive value  of irradiated foods apparently 
undergoes little if any change although some of the fat-soluble vitamins 
are affected by sterilization  doses.
Sentence 31:  7.431242172740858 
3137.
Sentence 32: for irradiation of food the results  obtained depend upon the 
dose rather than the specific type of radiation  and x-ray gamma and 
high-energy electron radiation are suitable.
Sentence 33: 5.635679345667413 
3138.
Sentence 34: aside from availability and economic considerations each has 
certain  practical advantages; for example gamma rays give deeper 
penetration but cannot be focused or collimated whereas unidirectional 
electron  beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of 
the  food package to be irradiated.
Sentence 35:  6.3898820060448465 
3139.
Sentence 36: selection of a source for commercial irradiation  would involve 
consideration of numerous factors including required  dose rate load 
factor throughput convenience safety and most  important costs.
  4.853876284793092 
3140.
Sentence 37: of the potentially useful sources of ionizing  radiations gamma 
sources cobalt-60 cesium-137 fission products  or a reactor 
irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium  salt have 
received most attention for food-preservation systems.
Sentence 38:  6.796228521202161 
Sentence 1: 3141.
Sentence 2: of the various particle accelerators the van de graff machines 
resonant  transformers and linear accelerators are the principal ones 
available  for commercial use.
Sentence 3:  6.55782030867378 
3142.
Sentence 4: costs of the effective energy produced by these sources is a major 
obstacle in the development of food-preservation  processes.
  9.271403564062782 
3143.
Sentence 5: estimated production costs of radiation energy  from machine and 
nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per kwhr.
Sentence 6:  5.236383152695367 
3144.
Sentence 7: conventional  energy for processing foods is available in the 
range of  at most a few cents per kwhr for electric power and the 
equivalent of a few mills per kwhr for process steam.
Sentence 8:  6.559180980563432 
3145.
Sentence 9: radiation therefore is at an initial cost disadvantage even though 
only 1 to 10 per cent as  much radiation energy as heat energy is 
required for radiopasteurization  or radiosterilization.
Sentence 10: 5.407323869298529 
3146.
Sentence 11: what are the possibilities of lowered radiation  production costs 
for the future?  13.69055793383496 
3147.
Sentence 12:  it has been estimated that for  applications on a megawatt scale 
costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per kwhr for 
large-scale accelerators or for  gamma radiation generated in a reactor 
core.
Sentence 13: 5.970744407689593 
3148.
Sentence 14: no comparable reductions  in the cost of nuclide radiation are 
foreseen.
Sentence 15:  10.594314053604894 
3149.
Sentence 16: such projections however  appear highly  speculative and the 
capacities involved are far beyond  those foreseen for food-
preservation facilities.
Sentence 17:  6.113769289643686 
3150.
Sentence 18: because agricultural  activities are seasonal and the areas of 
production and harvest of many foods are widely scattered geographically 
and because of  the high cost of transporting bulk food items any 
substantial distance  to a central processing location the use of large 
central processing  stations where low-cost radiation facilities 
approaching the megawatt  range might be utilized is inherently 
impracticable.
Sentence 19:  6.249974144697622 
3151.
Sentence 20: of irradiation preservation of foods  the objective of complete
  sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable 
product  capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended 
periods  of time.
Sentence 21:  5.618424604867241 
3152.
Sentence 22: chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military
  services.
Sentence 23:  9.390603782275125 
3153.
Sentence 24: for them providing appetizing food under battle or emergency
  conditions is a paramount consideration.
Sentence 25:  6.800157167832778 
3154.
Sentence 26: they require completely  sterile foods capable of being stored 
without refrigeration preferably  items already cooked and ready to eat.
  7.685753391288286 
3155.
Sentence 27: high nutritional value variety  palatability and appetizing 
appearance are important for reasons  of morale.
Sentence 28: 6.80337331187083 
3156.
Sentence 29: foods for rear stations which require cooking but no refrigeration
  are also of interest.
Sentence 30: 7.322582207589122 
3157.
Sentence 31: of primary interest are meats.
Sentence 32:  12.351857851149944 
3158.
Sentence 33: radiopasteurization which produces fewer adverse sensory changes
  in food products has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping
  qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items.
Sentence 34:  6.221143152558621 
3159.
Sentence 35: thus food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit 
the consumer to enjoy more  produce at peak freshness and palatability.
  5.936991473365929 
3160.

Sentence 6: of particular interest to the military services is the 
demonstration that roast pork after radiosterilization  is superior in 
palatability to available canned pork products.
Sentence 7:  7.836394009972727 
3165.
Sentence 8: tests with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the 
development of off-flavors.
Sentence 9:  6.9253581715417205 
3166.
Sentence 10: a prime objective of the army quartermaster corps program is to 
find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means  of overcoming it 
since it is a major and desirable dietary item.
Sentence 11:  9.627908346520304 
3167.
Sentence 12: partly  because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate 
enzymes  before radiosterilization treated fresh meats have the 
appearance of  boiled or canned meat.
Sentence 13: 5.0176589645046334 
3168.
Sentence 14: off-flavor is a less severe problem with  the 
radiopasteurization of meats but problems of commercial acceptability
  remain.
Sentence 15:  6.886249538313906 
3169.
Sentence 16: moderate radiation doses of from 100000 to 200000 rads  can extend 
the shelf life of fresh beef from 5 days  to 5 or 6 weeks.
  4.853876284793092 
3170.
Sentence 17: however the problem of consumer acceptability remains.

3174.
Sentence 24: ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger  have a 
relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and radiopasteurization
  might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping  qualities.
  6.252533361664298 
3175.
Sentence 25: however a major problem here is one of scale of processing;
  ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local
  level whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would 
require  central processing and distribution facilities.
  5.407362030088933 
3176.
Sentence 26: the problems of color change by blanching and liquid accumulation 
within the package are the same as for solid cuts.
Sentence 27: 8.333362590655405 
3177.
Sentence 28: specialty cooked items containing meat portions as in frozen 
dinners might offer a potential use  for radiopasteurization.
  5.427950274147271

Sentence 29: the principal potential advantage would be  that the finished 
product could be transported and stored at lower cost  under 
refrigeration instead of being frozen.
Sentence 30: 7.112393625717184 
3179.
Sentence 31: a refrigerated item  could also be heated and served in less time 
than is required for frozen foods of the same type.

3183.
Sentence 39: the table on page 10 shows costs of canning  and freezing meat and 
estimated costs for irradiation under certain  assumed conditions.
  5.670580783382225 
3184.
Sentence 40: under the conditions of comparison it will  radiosterilization is 
more  radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-

of chicken can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage 
as compared with about 10 days for the untreated product.
  5.023232342000959 
3188.
Sentence 8: acceptable taste and  odor are retained by the irradiated and 
refrigerated chicken.
Sentence 9: 7.615092762846159 
3189.
Sentence 10: acceptance of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed however 
for two  reasons: the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration
  is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved 
sanitation and distributing practices and treatment by antibiotics a 
measure  already approved by the federal food and drug administration
  serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 
0.

Sentence 14: furthermore it has made an exact assessment of the removal 
mechanisms possible.
Sentence 15:  8.066087806204921 
3193.
Sentence 16: the instrument is shown in fig 1 and consists  essentially of a 
hard sharp tungsten carbide knife which is pushed  along the substrate to 
remove the coating.
Sentence 17:  6.1087530504434815 
3194.
Sentence 18: the force required to accomplish removal is plotted by means of an 
electronic recorder against distance of removal.
Sentence 19:  8.458510492086722 
3195.
Sentence 20: since the removal force is a function of coating  thickness a 
differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into  the 
instrument to accurately measure film thickness.
Sentence 21:  5.673086325235781 
3196.
Sentence 22: this too is  recorded against distance by a repeat run over the 
same track previously cut.
Sentence 23:  8.610921896061667 
3197.
Sentence 24: a number of adjustment features are included in the hesiometer

manual knife scratching tests.
Sentence 29:  6.9463712601859715 
3200.
Sentence 30: the instrumental method however is about 100 times more sensitive 
and yields numerical  results which can be accurately repeated at wil 
over a period of time.
Sentence 31: 7.936307284371113 
3201.
Sentence 32: if a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from
  a substrate by an instrument like the hesiometer with a knife of 
constant  rake angle a number of removal mechanisms are often observed
  which depend upon the thickness of the coating.
Sentence 33:  5.617220309501041 
3202.
Sentence 34: at low thicknesses a  cutting phenomenon is often encountered.
  11.71351514332805 
3203.
Sentence 35: as the coating  becomes thicker the cutting may abruptly change to 
a cracking type of  failure.
Sentence 36:  7.544677787280255 
3204.
Sentence 37: if the coating becomes still thicker a peeling type failure
  finally can occur.
Sentence 38:  10.72322358388218 
Sentence 1: 3205.
Sentence 2: the typical appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated in 
figs 2 3 and 4 which are single frame enlargements of high speed movies 
taken during the course of the knife removal process.
Sentence 3:  5.972641820047624 
3206.
Sentence 4: it can be seen from fig 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from 
its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the  coating.
  10.065540309426087 
3207.
Sentence 5: the molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are
  obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and
  failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the 
knife and extending to the coating surface.
Sentence 6:  5.322154394325318 
3208.
Sentence 7: the pictures of figs  3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types 
of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at or 
close to the interface between  coating and substrate.
Sentence 8: 6.714092963077151 
3209.
Sentence 9: if the force required to remove the  coatings is plotted against 
film thickness a graph as illustrated schematically  in fig 5 may 
characteristically result.
Sentence 10: 6.165702921912899 
3210.
Sentence 11: here h  is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the 
surface of the  substrate and t is the film thickness.
Sentence 12: 9.909658482959113 
3211.
Sentence 13: it can be seen that  the force is characteristic of the removal 
process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal.
  8.959321006754546 
3212.
Sentence 14: also it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of 
failure show a steady state response while the cracking mechanism is of a 
dynamic nature.
Sentence 15:  7.0145225515164125 
3213.
Sentence 16: it should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the
  same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function 
of  changes in coatings thickness.
Sentence 17:  7.63296546060657 
3214.
Sentence 18: presumably the interfacial bond strength  and gross cohesive 
properties are identical in each case.
Sentence 19: 7.290347670517163 
3215.
Sentence 20: what then  are the factors that contribute to these phenomena?
  8.172042307755929 
3216.
Sentence 21:  why should  the practical adhesion of a coating as assessed by 
a knife method  change initially increasing rather rapidly and then 
decreasing stepwise  to very low values as the knife is forced through 
a coating of increasing  thickness? 6.073238484235858 
3217.
Sentence 22:  the  cutting removal process has been previously described.
  7.14162538120728 
3218.
Sentence 23: it was found that the coating is separated from its substrate 
entirely  by cohesive failure.
Sentence 24:  12.101549542797414 
3219.
Sentence 25: the details of the removal process are shown schematically in fig 
6.
Sentence 26:  9.942667879566706 
3220.
Sentence 27: the various forces result from the reaction  of the removed paint 
chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane which makes 
an angle |f with the substrate.
Sentence 28:  7.839984668539578 
3221.
Sentence 29: the  action and reaction forces are r and f respectively and are 
equal and opposite in direction.
Sentence 30:  5.504013763918864 
3222.
Sentence 31: all the other force vectors are  derived from these.
  14.75695949617052 
3223.
Sentence 32: f is the force required to cut a coating of thickness  t from the 
substrate.
Sentence 33: 6.195671823596846 
3224.
Sentence 34: f is the shear force along the shear  plane; f and f are the 
thrust forces acting against coating and knife respectively; f is the 
normal compressive force acting  on the shear plane; f is the friction 
force between chip and knife surfaces and p is the normal force acting on 
the face of the  knife.
Sentence 35:  5.815072742533981 
3225.
Sentence 36: |a is the rake angle of the knife; |f is the angle the shear plane 
makes with the substrate; |t is the friction angle; and |b is the angle 
the resultants make with the plane of  the substrate.
Sentence 37:  4.473134263127645 
Sentence 1: 3226.
Sentence 2: an analysis of the vector relationships shows  that the rake 
angle |a and the friction angle |t determine the vector direction f of 
the force resultants r and f.
Sentence 3:  7.056142647473741 
3227.
Sentence 4: consequently  both the rake angle of the knife as well as the 
friction  occurring between the back of the removed coating and the 
front of the  knife will determine in large part the detailed 
mechanism of the cutting  removal process.
Sentence 5: 6.534303111787784 
3228.
Sentence 6: it is difficult to measure the direction  and magnitude of r 
directly.
Sentence 7:  19.069878647075285 
3229.
Sentence 8: in actual practice the values most  readily amenable to 
measurement are the cutting force f and the  shear angle |f.
  6.144849616704715 
3230.
Sentence 9: these two values and the rake angle |a are  sufficient to 
determine the other parameters of these relationships.
Sentence 10:  8.798547020654512 
3231.
Sentence 11: |a is defined by the geometry of the knife; |f can readily  be 
determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after
  cutting from the substrate; f is instrumentally determined.
  4.926198120782607 
3232.
Sentence 12: from fig 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be
  derived and the cutting force is f where |l is the shear strength
  of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material w  is 
the width of the removed coating and t is its thickness.
Sentence 13: 5.881729196226396 
3233.
Sentence 14: if the cutting force f is plotted against film thickness  a 
straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope
 f.
Sentence 15:  6.517396121441633 
3234.
Sentence 16: however in the actual assessment of the cutting force by 
instrumental  methods for any thickness of coating a number of 
spurious effects occur which must be taken into account and which make 
the measured  value larger than the true cutting force indicated by 
eqn.
Sentence 17: 0.0 
3235.
Sentence 18: one of these is the fact that the knife employed no  matter how 
well sharpened will have a slightly rounded cutting edge.
  10.390780708029016 
3236.
Sentence 19: this signifies that |a the rake angle is no longer a constant  to 
zero film thickness.
Sentence 20:  9.06649552733653 
3237.
Sentence 21: the curvature of this bluntness is in the  case of the carboloy 
knife employed in the hesiometer determined by  the grain sizes of the 
polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals  cemented together in 
the knife body and is in the order of 0.
Sentence 22:  6.442923355315638 
3238.
Sentence 23: the force vector concept of fig 6 can readily be  applied to this 
condition also.
Sentence 24:  8.483713382005185 
3239.
Sentence 25: because the rake angle f at the tip  of the knife is very much 
smaller when compared to the value of |a for the major portion of the 
knife a very rapid  increase in cutting force with thickness will 
result.
Sentence 26:  6.188890245149814 
3240.
Sentence 27: this reduces  to the relationship: f where f is the intercept at 
zero thickness  of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn f is 
the  thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the 
knife tip f is a straight line first approximation of this roundness and
  the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn.
Sentence 28:  6.150998561151396 
3241.
Sentence 29: it can be  seen that f is a constant and is determined for the most 
part by the geometry of the knife.
Sentence 30: 8.580937438440444 
3242.
Sentence 31: the blunter the knife the higher is the value  of f.
  9.430036403335416 
3243.
Sentence 32: the importance of a hard abrasion resistant knife material  like 
the carboloy employed in the hesiometer immediately becomes  apparent.
  6.788627930487371 
3244.
Sentence 33: softer knives would blunt very rapidly making the value of  f 
inexact.
Sentence 34:  7.615092762846159 
Sentence 1: 3245.
Sentence 2: in extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even
  change during the course of a measurement.
Sentence 3:  8.516670420680711 
3246.
Sentence 4: a second  factor which enters into the practical measurement of 
the instrumentally  determined cutting force is the frictional 
resistance caused  by the bottom of the knife against the substrate.
  7.522740496252002 
3247.
Sentence 5: this is not a constant value like f but varies with the thickness of 
the coating and the  direction and magnitude of the resultants r and f 
of fig 6.
Sentence 6:  7.607171463682988 
3248.
Sentence 7: under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust
  f against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or
  lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction 
of f.
Sentence 8: 7.349134743676916 
3249.
Sentence 9: the resultant friction force f is thus directly proportional to
  f and consequently also to film thickness.
Sentence 10:  6.161534271336119 
3250.
Sentence 11: the value of f  can readily be assessed by determining the 
frictional force exerted  on the knife while running over the 
previously stripped coating track under various external loadings.
  7.391760813846135 
3251.
Sentence 12: a straight line relationship is usually  observed in a plot of 
f against load l having slope k  and f since the load l under actual 
cutting conditions  is caused by f it can be seen that f   the 
measured force  h in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates 
consequently  can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut 
the  coating f that due to the bluntness of the knife f and that due
  to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate f
  or f the first two forces are directly interrelated and depend
  upon film thickness whereas f is independent of these two and is a
  constant for a given knifecoating combination.
Sentence 13:  4.820942016153744 
3252.
Sentence 14: these theoretical  relationships are more clearly illustrated in 
fig 7 and their  sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical 
measurements made  with the hesiometer as illustrated in the first 
portion of fig 5 for the cutting mechanism.
Sentence 15:  7.517477050756409 
3253.
Sentence 16: although a large number of coatings systems  particularly at low 
thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism  frequently a 
second type of cohesive failure may also take place.
Sentence 17:  6.658768457673502 
3254.
Sentence 18: this is a chipping dynamic type failure encountered with very 
brittle  coatings resins or very highly pigmented films.
  10.056703068196963 
3255.
Sentence 19: this is shown in the photomicrograph of fig 8.
  12.028312619574876 
3256.
Sentence 20: the basic difference between  the continuous cutting mechanism 
and that of the chipping mechanism  is that instead of shear 
occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without fracture 
rupture intermittently occurs along the shear plane.
Sentence 21:  7.471800079255708 
3257.
Sentence 22: the detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been
  studied extensively by merchant for metal cutting and the 
principles found can be directly applied to coatings.
Sentence 23:  6.319948449042945 
3258.
Sentence 24: by studying  high speed movies made of this type of failure the 
sequence of relationships  as schematically illustrated in fig 9 could 
be observed.
Sentence 25:  8.870772111304845 
3259.
Sentence 26: in the first picture the knife is just beginning to advance  into 
the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip  formation.
  7.523963690989004 
3260.
Sentence 27: in the next the shear plane angle is high and extends to  the 
inclined work surface.
Sentence 28: 10.739140770264825 
3261.
Sentence 29: with increasing advance of the knife into  the coating the shear 
plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear  angle rapidly 
decreases.
Sentence 30: 5.838619445834961 
Sentence 1: 3262.
Sentence 2: eventually rupture occurs along the shear  plane and the cycle 
repeats itself.
Sentence 3:  8.106037171194833 
3263.
Sentence 4: merchant  has found that the same basic relationships which 
describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting 
mechanism can also be applied to the discontinuous chip formation 
provided the proper values  of instantaneous shear angle and 
instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional  area are used.
  5.51153769381625 
3264.
Sentence 5: consequently if the shear angle |f  is replaced by the rupture 
angle f the relationships as described in  eqns will directly apply.
  6.406051459100846 
3265.
Sentence 6: mechanism  under equilibrium cutting conditions the chip exerts a
  force f against the coating and an equal opposite force f against
  the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in fig 6.
  5.772533502858223 
3266.
Sentence 7: if the  rake angle |a of the knife is high enough and the 
friction angle  |t between the front of the knife and the back of the 
chip is low enough to give a positive value for f the resultant vector r
  will lie above the plane of the substrate.
Sentence 8:  8.059278969844982 
3267.
Sentence 9: within only a few years foamed plastics materials have managed
  to grow into an integral and important phase of the plastics 
industry-  and the end is still not yet in sight.
Sentence 10: 6.457755946111507 
3268.
Sentence 11: urethane foam as only one example was only introduced commercially 
in this country in 1955.
Sentence 12: 8.525583087680541 
3269.
Sentence 13: yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb and 
expectations  are for a market of 275 million lb by 1964.
  5.485931181203066 
3270.
Sentence 14: many of the other  foamed plastics particularly the styrenes 
show similar growth potential.

Sentence 4: lacking reliable data for some  of the variables we are relying 
on experimental data of about 20 percent  internal losses for 14-inch 
long small diameter  fibers.
Sentence 5:  5.111000576664747 
3498.
Sentence 6: this relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber
  diameters increasing the number of internal reflections.
  9.166756980583028 
3499.
Sentence 7: since we are  considering here relatively small diameter fiber 
plates  their average thickness can be kept below 14 inch and their 
internal  losses may be assumed as 15 percent.
Sentence 8:  5.439412535771187 
3500.
Sentence 9: the packing  efficiency fr of fiber plates did not receive much 
attention  in the literature probably as it is high for the larger fibers 
generally  used until rather recently.
Sentence 10: 7.8869241986042775 
3501.
Sentence 11: for circular fibers in a closely packed hexagonal array the 
packing efficiency is given by: f where f and 0.
Sentence 12:  5.929729974125496

Sentence 19: 5|m hence f and f.
Sentence 20:  8.254441635698543 
3506.
Sentence 21: thus the efficiency |t couplers is given by- f or approximately
  50 percent each.
Sentence 22: 7.391013650626644 
3507.
Sentence 23: it must be remembered that the fiber plates replace  a glass 
window and a membrane in addition to an optical  output lens system.
  8.192759518930824 
3508.
Sentence 24: the efficiency f of an f lens at the magnification f is: f 
neglecting absorption the end losses of the coupling  membrane and the 
output window f would be 6 percent and 8 percent.
Sentence 25:  6.226273678698645 
3509.
Sentence 26: thus the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two
  fiber plates is 0.
Sentence 27:  7.344826497149266 
3510.
Sentence 28: 043 or about  gain of fiber  including the brightness gain f 
due  to the f area demagnification the overall gain of a fiber coupled 
double  stage image intensifier is: f it is obvious that the careful
  choice of photocathode which maximizes f for a given input e  is 
very important.
Sentence 29:  6.205372672477747 
3511.
Sentence 30: the same consideration should govern the choice  of the second-
stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral  sensitivity of 
the ultimate sensor.
Sentence 31:  6.127181057961793 
3512.
Sentence 32: we have evaluated the matching integrals for two types  of 
photocathodes and three types of light input.
Sentence 33:  9.086762498902816 
3513.
Sentence 34: the input light distributions considered are p-11 and p- 20
  phosphor emission and the so-called night light  as given by hw 
babcock and j j johnson.
Sentence 35:  5.327707589329553 
3514.
Sentence 36: the integrals  are listed in table 14-1 below:  discussion of 
paraxial device resolution  _resolution limitations  the resolution 
limitations for a single stage are  given by the inherent resolution 
of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of 
the cathodoluminescent viewing  screen.
Sentence 37:  6.208221715819111 
3515.
Sentence 38: the resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system  depend on 
both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations.
  7.374669555731543 
3516.
Sentence 39: it has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system 
yields  a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with 
unity magnification.
Sentence 40: 9.084762115428768 
Sentence 1: 3517.
Sentence 2: furthermore the chromatic aberrations depend on the chosen high 
voltage.
Sentence 3:  6.903819216005966 
3518.
Sentence 4: in general a high anode voltage reduces  chromatic aberrations 
and thus increases the obtainable resolution.
Sentence 5:  9.480380115267906 
3519.
Sentence 6: the luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from eq
  for the 16 possible combinations of s-11 and s-20 photocathodes
  and p-11 and p-20 phosphor screens for night light and p-20 light 
input.
Sentence 7:  4.908401855518352

Sentence 10: the following efficiencies obtained from jedec  and rca 
specifications were used: f   the following  table gain values computed 
according  to eq with f:   the possibility of a space charge  blowup of 
the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has  been 
pointed out.
Sentence 11:  5.202480459306776 
3522.
Sentence 12: it is obvious that such an influence can only be  expected in the 
final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output  levels.
  9.94436696991894 
3523.
Sentence 13: space charge influences will also decrease at increased voltages.
  6.987307572036626 
3524.
Sentence 14: electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have been tested 
for resolution capabilities by applying electronography.
Sentence 15: 7.032105024464237 
3525.
Sentence 16: a resolution of 70-80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be 
feasible.
Sentence 17:  7.870513614425933 
3526.
Sentence 18: the inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor
  screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness  decreases 
with decreasing porosity  and might be impaired by the normally used 
aluminum mirror.
Sentence 19: 6.759075170978014 
3527.
Sentence 20: thus in general elementary light optical effects light scatter and 
electron scatter determine the obtainable  resolution limit.
  7.123801189811166 
3528.
Sentence 21: it should be noted that photoluminescence  due to bremsstrahlung 
generated within the viewing screen by electron  impact appears to be 
important only if anode voltages in excess  of 30 kv are utilized.
  10.171388639244205 
3529.
Sentence 22: it has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent phosphor screens 
may have a limiting resolution of 60 f at high voltage values of 
approximately 20 kv.
Sentence 23:  7.434736587010844 
3530.
Sentence 24: for the further discussion  we shall thus assume an electron 
optical resolution of 80 f  and phosphor screen resolution of 60 f.
  7.92189051246282 
3531.
Sentence 25: the set of all decisions is called the operating policy or more 
simply  the policy.
Sentence 26: 6.70442043428815 
3532.
Sentence 27: an optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the  best out of 
the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product.
  10.049476075112374 
3533.
Sentence 28: there are thus three components to an optimal design problem: the 
specification of the operating variables and the transformation  the 
specification of the objective function of which the optimization is 
desired.
Sentence 29:  6.010613279095055 
3534.
Sentence 30: for a chemical process the  first of these might involve the 
concentrations of the different chemical  species and the temperature 
or pressure of the stream.
Sentence 31:  8.21051322268281 
3535.
Sentence 32: for the  second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or 
amount of cooling  to be supplied; the way in which the 
transformation of state depends  on the operating variables for the main 
types of reactors is discussed  in the next chapter.
Sentence 33:  5.949045901713329 
3536.
Sentence 34: the objective function is some measure of  the increase in value 
of the stream by processing; it is the subject  of chapter 4.
  8.356493960437957 
Sentence 1: 3537.
Sentence 2: the essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of 
the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages  with no feedback was 
first isolated by bellman.
Sentence 3:  5.944922442780418 
3538.
Sentence 4: he recognized that  whatever transformation may be effected in 
the first stage of an r-stage  process the remaining stages must use 
an optimal f-stage policy  with respect to the state resulting from the 
first stage if there  is to be any chance of optimizing the complete 
process.
Sentence 5:  7.713262285813877 
3539.
Sentence 6: moreover by  systematically varying the operating conditions in 
the first stage and  always using the optimal f-stage policy for the 
remaining stages we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all r 
stages.
Sentence 7:  5.329540144897029 
3540.
Sentence 8: proceeding in this way from one to two and from two to three stages 
we  may gradually build up the policy for any number.
Sentence 9:  7.766318240882622 
3541.
Sentence 10: at each step of the  calculation the operating variables of only 
one stage need be varied.
Sentence 11:  7.595030694353987 
3542.
Sentence 12: to see how important this economy is let us suppose that there
  are m operating variables at each stage and that the state  is 
specified by n variables; then the search for the maximum  at any one 
stage will require a number of operations of order f  .
  7.2701772592996265 
3543.
Sentence 13: to proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed 
states must be investigated to allow of interpolation; this number will 
be of the order  of f.
Sentence 14: 5.932038371272668 
3544.
Sentence 15: if however we are seeking the optimal r-stage policy  for a given 
feed state only one search for a maximum is required at the final step.
  7.3943616279429145 
3545.
Sentence 16: thus a number of operations of the order of f are required.
  12.207232173175122 
3546.
Sentence 17: if all the operating variables were varied simultaneously  f 
operations would be required to do the same job and as r increases this 
increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations
  required by the dynamic program.
Sentence 18:  7.671099215086915 
3547.
Sentence 19: but even more important than  this is the fact that the direct 
search by simultaneously varying all  operating conditions has produced 
only one optimal policy namely that  for the given feed state and r 
stages.
Sentence 20:  6.478356009977129 
3548.
Sentence 21: in contrast the dynamic  program produces this policy and a 
whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages.
  8.328456479183021 
3549.
Sentence 22: if the problem is enlarged to require  a complete coverage of feed 
states f operations are needed by the dynamic  program and f by the 
direct search.
Sentence 23:  6.252870165152844 
3550.
Sentence 24: but f is vastly larger than r.
Sentence 25:  14.306364280244424 
3551.
Sentence 26: no optimism is more baseless than that which believes  that the 
high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the  crudest of 
methods in searching out a result.
Sentence 27:  5.147795169008453 
3552.
Sentence 28: suppose that f and  that the average operation requires only f 
sec.
Sentence 29:  8.587029108688856 
3553.
Sentence 30: then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the 
direct search would  take  more than three millennia!   the principle of 
optimality thus  brings a vital organization into the search for the 
optimal policy of  a multistage decision process.
Sentence 31:  5.438494564100928 
3554.
Sentence 32: bellman has annunciated in the  following terms:   an optimal 
policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial 
decision are the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy 
with respect to the state resulting  from the first decision.
  6.433520450586074 
3555.
Sentence 33: this is the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up 
a functional equation.
Sentence 34: 10.930775730979924 
Sentence 1: 3556.
Sentence 2: it appears in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the 
digital  computer.
Sentence 3:  11.693712841932427 
3557.
Sentence 4: at the same time every device that can be employed to reduce the 
number of variables is of the greatest value and it is one of the 
attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for
  ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end.
  7.551369506463521 
3558.
Sentence 5: the discrete deterministic process  consider the process 
illustrated in fig 2.
Sentence 6:  9.945332631078985 
3559.
Sentence 7: 1 consisting of r distinct stages.
Sentence 8: 10.162698742101748 
3560.
Sentence 9: these will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the 
process  stream so that stage r is the rth stage from the end.
  6.7301008326787635 
3561.
Sentence 10: let the state of the stream leaving stage r be denoted by a vector
  f and the operating variables of stage r by f.
Sentence 11:  6.805341775456598 
3562.
Sentence 12: thus f denotes the state of the feed to the r-stage process and
  f the state of the product from the last stage.
Sentence 13:  9.820335087733522 
3563.
Sentence 14: each stage transforms the state f of its feed to the state f in a 
way that depends on  the operating variables f.
Sentence 15:  6.891016206689562 
3564.
Sentence 16: this transformation  is uniquely determined by f and we therefore 
speak of the process  as deterministic.
Sentence 17:  9.273238270682372 
3565.
Sentence 18: in practical situations there will be restrictions on the admissible 
operating conditions and we regard the vectors as belonging  to a fixed 
and bounded set s.
Sentence 19:  5.994528108156906 
3566.
Sentence 20: the set of vectors f  constitutes the operating policy or more 
briefly the policy and a  policy is admissible if all the f belong to 
s.
Sentence 21:  7.121574595755137 
3567.
Sentence 22: when the policy has been chosen the state of the product can be 
obtained from the  state of the feed by repeated application of the 
transformation;  thus f.
Sentence 23:  8.23494310113226 
3568.
Sentence 24: the objective function which is to be maximized is some function 
usually piecewise continuous of the product state.
Sentence 25: 9.647144077243745 
3569.
Sentence 26: let this  be denoted by f.
Sentence 27: 11.98058228218936 
3570.
Sentence 28: an optimal policy is an admissible policy  f which maximizes the 
objective function p.
Sentence 29: 7.908664602512112 
3571.
Sentence 30: the policy may  not be unique but the maximum value of p certainly 
is and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by
  as a function of the feed state f.
Sentence 31:  5.1617518647114595 
3572.
Sentence 32: let f where the maximization  is over all admissible policies 
f.
Sentence 33:  10.011690633046488 
3573.
Sentence 34: when it is necessary to be specific  we say that the optimal 
policy is an optimal r-stage policy  with respect to the feed state f.
  8.472918560529706 
3574.
Sentence 35: for any choice of admissible  policy f in the first stage the 
state of the stream leaving this stage is given by f.
Sentence 36:  9.278321030873448 
3575.
Sentence 37: this is the feed state of the subsequent  f stages which 
according to the principle of optimality must use an  optimal f-stage 
policy with respect to this state.
Sentence 38:  9.075230255308774 
3576.
Sentence 39: this will result in a value f of the objective function and when f 
is chosen correctly  this will give f the maximum of the objective 
function.
Sentence 40:  7.147464881877732 
3577.
Sentence 41: thus f  where the maximization is over all admissible policies f 
and f is related to f by can be solved  for f when f is known and clearly 
f the maximization being  over all admissible f.
Sentence 42: 4.5421746389230675 
3578.
Sentence 43: the set of equations and the  starting equation is of a 
recursive type well suited to programming  on the digital computer.
  7.762609397140794 
3579.
Sentence 44: in finding the optimal r-stage policy  from that of f stages only 
the function f is needed.
Sentence 45:  6.460757856108023 
Sentence 1: 3580.
Sentence 2: when f has been found it may be transferred into the storage 
location of f and the whole calculation repeated.
Sentence 3:  8.246514118375284 
3581.
Sentence 4: we also see how the results may be presented although if n the 
number of state variables  is large any tabulation will become 
cumbersome.
Sentence 5: 6.3822034550297495 
3582.
Sentence 6: a table or set of tables  may be set out as in table 2.
  8.55371701457874 
3583.
Sentence 7: to extract the optimal r-stage policy with respect to the feed state 
f we enter section  r of this table at the state f and find 
immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective 
function.
Sentence 8:  5.703633493391938 
3584.
Sentence 9: in  the third column is given the optimal policy for stage r and
  in the fourth the resulting state of the stream when this policy is 
used.
Sentence 10: 6.728997285543211 
3585.
Sentence 11: since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an
  optimal f-stage policy with respect to f we may enter section f
  of the table at this state f and read off the optimal policy for 
stage f and the resulting state f.
Sentence 12: 5.118833452401329 
3586.
Sentence 13: proceeding in this way up the table  we extract the complete 
optimal policy and if it is desired we can check on f by evaluating f at 
the last stage.
Sentence 14:  8.202941771014192 
3587.
Sentence 15: it may be  that the objective function depends not only on f but 
also on f  as when the cost of the operating policy is considered.
  7.706774027418336 
3588.
Sentence 16: a moment's reflection shows that the above algorithm and 
presentation work equally  well in this case.
Sentence 17:  7.88014969880378 
3589.
Sentence 18: a form of objective function that we shall often  have occasion to 
consider is f.
Sentence 19:  7.17950040656453 
3590.
Sentence 20: here v represents the  the cost  of operating the stage with 
conditions .
Sentence 21:  11.259636964467346 
3591.
Sentence 22: hence p  is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of 
operation that  is the net profit.
Sentence 23:  7.503951698706899 
3592.
Sentence 24: if f denotes the net profit from stage r  and f then the 
principle of optimality gives f this sequence  of equations may be 
started with the remark that with no process f there  is no profit ie 
f.
Sentence 25:  6.800750486020274 
3593.
Sentence 26: the process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only
  statistically is also of interest although for chemical reactor 
design  it is not as important as the deterministic process.
  7.6079195329582205 
3594.
Sentence 27: in this case  the stage r operating with conditions f transforms 
the state  of the stream from f to f but only the probability 
distribution of  f is known.
Sentence 28: 7.360130383667018 
3595.
Sentence 29: this is specified by a distribution function f such  that the 
probability that f lies in some region d of the stage  space is f.
  6.268968593365866 
3596.
Sentence 30: we cannot now speak of maximizing the value  of the objective 
function since this function is now known only in a  probabilistic 
sense.
Sentence 31:  8.058402443511438 
3597.
Sentence 32: we can however maximize its expected value.
Sentence 33:  11.933630927614972 
3598.
Sentence 34: for  a single stage we may define f where the maximization is by 
choice  of f.
Sentence 35: 7.032105024464237 
3599.
Sentence 36: we thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected  value 
of the objective function for a given f.
Sentence 37:  6.484698453818843 
3600.
Sentence 38: if we consider a process  in which the outcome of one stage is 
known before passage to the next then the principle of optimality shows 
that the policy in subsequent  stages should be optimal with respect 
to the outcome of the first.
Sentence 39: 8.148566495101765 
3601.
Sentence 40: then f the maximization being over all admissible f and the 
integration over the whole of stage space.
Sentence 41:  6.3733921415345565 
Sentence 1: 3602.
Sentence 2: the type of presentation  of results used in the deterministic 
process may be used here except  that now the fourth column is 
redundant.
Sentence 3: 8.96042901832664 
3603.
Sentence 4: the third column gives the optimal policy but we must wait to see 
the outcome of stage r and enter the preceding section of the table at 
this state.
Sentence 5: 7.1514735154402835 
3604.
Sentence 6: the  discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage 
is not  known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult 
matter.
Sentence 7:  7.158709062449044 
3605.
Sentence 8: in many cases it is not  possible to divide the process into a 
finite number of discrete stages  since the state of the stream is 
transformed in a continuous manner  through the process.
  6.300916785450441 
3606.
Sentence 9: we replace r the number of the stage  from the end of the process 
by t a continuous variable which  measures the distance of the point 
considered from the end of the  process.
Sentence 10:  11.140874931348808 
3607.
Sentence 11: the word distance is used here in a rather general sense;  it 
may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the
  process.
Sentence 12:  6.868674993622193 
3608.
Sentence 13: if t is the total length of the process its  feed state may be 
denoted by a vector  and the product  state by  denotes the state at

Sentence 14: a gyro-stabilized platform system using restrained gyros is  well 
suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-
platform-servo combination.
Sentence 15: 6.1002718645445935 
3610.
Sentence 16: the restrained gyro-stabilized platform  with reasonable 
response characteristics operates with an approximate  equation of 
motion neglecting transient effects as follows:  f where u is a torque 
applied about the output axis of the  controlling gyro.
  6.227116739151118 
3611.
Sentence 17: the platform angle |f is the angle about  which the gyro is 
controlling.
Sentence 18:  6.817408452020724 
3612.
Sentence 19: this is normally termed the gyro input axis 90` away from the gyro 
output or |j axis.
Sentence 20:  10.454030701015315 
3613.
Sentence 21: the gyro angular momentum is defined by h.
Sentence 22:  8.976097203071156 
3614.
Sentence 23: thus if the gyro and platform-controller  combination maintains 
the platform with zero angular  deviation about the |f axis the system 
can be rotated with an angular velocity f if a torque is supplied to the 
gyro output axis |j.
Sentence 24:  6.270627766869903 
3615.
Sentence 25: it is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers
  so that a torque can be applied about their output axes.
  8.230943349647005 
3616.
Sentence 26: in the system shown in fig 7-1 the accelerometer output is 
amplified  and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis 
torquer.
Sentence 27:  9.886217260266333 
3617.
Sentence 28: this torque causes the entire system to rotate about the |f  axis 
since the response to f.
Sentence 29:  6.137472201451243 
3618.
Sentence 30: if the polarities are correct the platform rotates in such a 
direction as to reduce the accelerometer output  to zero.
  9.59721944103896 
3619.
Sentence 31: as the accelerometer output is decreasing the torque applied  to 
the gyro output axis decreases and therefore the rate decreases.
  6.4704405399531035 
3620.
Sentence 32: finally when the accelerometer output is zero the entire system
  remains stationary and the platform is by definition leveled.
  7.288900799735519 
3621.
Sentence 33: a mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in
  fig 7-2.
Sentence 34:  6.869739491308488 
Sentence 1: 3622.
Sentence 2: the platform is initially off level by the angle |f.
  9.430036403335416 
3623.
Sentence 3: the angle generated by the platform servo |f multiplied by g  is 
the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer.
Sentence 4: 5.780140237098333 
3624.
Sentence 5: f  is the scale factor of the accelerometer.
Sentence 6:  9.924684914768017 
3625.
Sentence 7: the voltage f is amplified  by f and applied to the gyro torquer 
with scale factor f.
Sentence 8:  7.005525266517035 
3626.
Sentence 9: finally the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented
  by f the system as indicated in fig 7-2 is fundamental and simple
  because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the
  accelerometer have been neglected.
Sentence 10:  6.381145722783109 
3627.
Sentence 11: with these factors included an upper  limit is placed on the 
allowable loop gain by stability considerations.
Sentence 12:  7.680799626726051 
3628.
Sentence 13: in this type of system a high loop gain is desirable because it
  provides a fast response time.
Sentence 14:  9.702836094942622 
3629.
Sentence 15: when the frequency response characteristics  of practical 
components are considered their effect on  stability does not present 
the most serious limit on the system loop  gain.
Sentence 16: 5.950743172816236 
3630.
Sentence 17: the time required for the system to reach a level position is 
approximately  inversely proportional to the servo loop gain.
  8.395020531259691 
3631.
Sentence 18: in addition  the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is 
approximately proportional  to the servo loop gain; ie high loop gain 
causes the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations.
  5.658150040830737 
3632.
Sentence 19: this problem  usually determines the lower limit of loop gain 
rather than response  time.
Sentence 20: 8.823411164925119 
3633.
Sentence 21: it must be noticed in fig 7-1 that the accelerometer  responds to 
any input acceleration.
Sentence 22:  8.799215518229115 
3634.
Sentence 23: the equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle 
is f in practice the preflight  leveling process takes place with the 
system mounted in the airframe.
Sentence 24:  6.673055462121845 
3635.
Sentence 25: when the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform
  angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting 
on  the accelerometers.
Sentence 26:  6.985033348206907 
3636.
Sentence 27: there are many such components of acceleration present  due to the 
effect of wind gusts engine noise turbulence around  the vehicle etc.
  11.858661917697805 
3637.
Sentence 28: one of the greatest problems associated with automatic  leveling is 
establishing a true level in the presence of high-level acceleration 
noise.
Sentence 29:  10.838046414385232 
3638.
Sentence 30: one solution to the problem is to operate  with a low loop gain 
and to include low-pass filters.
Sentence 31:  11.399959901557546 
3639.
Sentence 32: this technique  causes the system to respond only to low frequency 
acceleration components  such as the platform tilt.
Sentence 33:  6.137472201451243 
3640.
Sentence 34: since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering  increases the 
response time a practical compromise must be reached.
Sentence 35:  7.590800568668409 
3641.
Sentence 36: one of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the  use of a 
non-linear amplifier for f.
Sentence 37: 9.699383048252644 
3642.
Sentence 38: the amplifier is designed so  that its gain is large for 
accelerometer signals above a certain threshold  level.
  7.663024046550707 
3643.
Sentence 39: below this level the amplifier gain f is proportional  and is of 
small value in order to provide adequate noise filtering.
  5.835473001769006 
3644.
Sentence 40: the  effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position 
at  a rapid rate until it is nearly level at which point the platform 
is  controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency 
response  so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process.
  6.240225426721251 
Sentence 1: 3645.
Sentence 2: when the system is on automatic leveling the gyro drift is canceled 
by  the output of the leveling system.
Sentence 3:  5.4560684206020245 
3646.
Sentence 4: the platform actually tilts off level so that the accelerometer 
output when amplified by f will supply the correct current to the gyro 
torquer to cancel  the gyro drift.
Sentence 5:  6.941335705905106 
3647.
Sentence 6: the amount of platform dip required depends upon the  scale 
factors of the system.
Sentence 7: 9.261350790332987 
3648.
Sentence 8: the automatic leveling system described in this section is readily
  adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three 
integrating gyros.
Sentence 9:  7.333060553020843 
3649.
Sentence 10: the system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits.
  9.265005517434957 
3650.
Sentence 11: however the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled
  remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform.
  8.630915665770779 
3651.
Sentence 12: this leveling system will hold the platform on-level automatically
  as long as the system is actuated.
Sentence 13:  7.736817524741486 
3652.
Sentence 14: a useful by-product of this system is that the information 
necessary to set the gyro drift biases is available from the currents 
necessary to hold the system in level.
Sentence 15: 7.8076921455580495 
3653.
Sentence 16: the leveling process can be accomplished manually and the results
  are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment.
  6.104044052552417 
3654.
Sentence 17: the  process consists in turning the platform manually until the 
outputs  of both accelerometers are zero.
Sentence 18:  7.032105024464237 
3655.
Sentence 19: the turning is accomplished by applying  voltage to the gyro 
torquers described above.
Sentence 20:  6.817408452020724 
3656.
Sentence 21: in brief the human  replaces amplifier f in figs 7-1 and 7- 2.
  10.12904140595632 
3657.
Sentence 22: manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the 
accelerometer outputs.
Sentence 23: 6.978177995769431 
3658.
Sentence 24: if  high accuracy is required in preflight leveling it is usually 
necessary  to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs
  .
Sentence 25:  7.04470725452639 
3659.
Sentence 26: with integration the effect of a small acceleration can be seen 
after a time.
Sentence 27:  8.77122911693304 
3660.
Sentence 28: however skill is required on the part of an operator to level a
  platform to any degree of accuracy.
Sentence 29:  9.496346167982761 
3661.
Sentence 30: also it requires more time as  compared to the automatic 
approach.
Sentence 31:  7.142947673187237 
3662.
Sentence 32: manual leveling is inconvenient  if the platform must be 
maintained accurately level for any prolonged  period of time.
  6.757567981697296 
3663.
Sentence 33: the operator must continually supply the correct  amount of turning 
current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift is 
canceled.
Sentence 34:  5.805447254345494 
3664.
Sentence 35: this process is especially difficult since gyro  drifting is 
typically random.
Sentence 36:  9.647666702688586 
3665.
Sentence 37: platform  heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the 
accelerometers  parallel to the desired coordinate system of the 
navigator.
Sentence 38: 5.396094141387029 
3666.
Sentence 39: in simpler terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper 
direction.
Sentence 40: 9.668330866206757 
3667.
Sentence 41: for purely inertial navigators two techniques are available  to 
accomplish the platform heading:  use of external or  surveying 
equipment to establish proper heading.
Sentence 42: 5.607450279891365 
3668.
Sentence 43: use of the characteristics of the platform components for an 
indication of true  heading the choice of the heading technique is 
dependent upon the accuracy requirements field conditions and the time 
available to accomplish  the heading.
Sentence 44:  7.226079837991202 
Sentence 1: 3669.
Sentence 2: with the gyro-stabilized platform leveled it can be  headed in 
the proper direction by using surveying techniques.
Sentence 3:  7.049728973261037 
3670.
Sentence 4: the platform  accelerometers must be slightly modified for this 
procedure.
Sentence 5: 10.282317167785038 
3671.
Sentence 6: before  the accelerometers are mounted on the platform the 
direction of  their sensitive axis must be accurately determined.
  5.593078119805652 
3672.
Sentence 7: a mirror is mounted  on each accelerometer so that the plane of 
the mirror is perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit.
  8.671512010393146 
3673.
Sentence 8: a precision transit  is set up so that it is aligned with respect 
to true north.
Sentence 9:  12.390238519607813 
3674.
Sentence 10: this can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying 
techniques.
Sentence 11: 9.89655331134606 
3675.
Sentence 12: with the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometers  is 
sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned.
Sentence 13: 7.719594709811595 
3676.
Sentence 14: the  sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the 
transit to project a beam of light which is darkened by crossed hairs on 
the accelerometer  mirror.
Sentence 15:  7.045515859671722 
3677.

the appropriate gyro torquers.
Sentence 20:  6.578982329721101 
3680.
Sentence 21: although this technique is  simple and satisfactory one practical 
difficulty does exist: the direction  of true north must be known for 
each launch point.
Sentence 22:  6.928763765787131 
3681.
Sentence 23: however  this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized 
that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few 
days' work.
Sentence 24: 6.035226674045869 
3682.
Sentence 25: in many installations the inertial platform is raised off the 
ground  a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before 
flight.
Sentence 26:  8.799743460193586 
3683.
Sentence 27: with this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform 
with  surveying equipment.
Sentence 28:  10.34800060135459 
3684.
Sentence 29: if the platform is not too high off the ground  a transit can be 
mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform.
Sentence 30: 9.508385408971838 
3685.
Sentence 31: obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since
  errors are introduced because of motion of the stand.
  5.929848169630036 
3686.
Sentence 32: the transit can be replaced by an autocollimator.
Sentence 33: 12.6078345414341 
3687.
Sentence 34: this instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the 
angular deviations  of the platform and can be used to automatically 
hold the platform  on true heading.
Sentence 35: 7.001786473599458 
3688.
Sentence 36: the electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified  and 
supplied to the z-gyro torquer.
Sentence 37:  8.346523409839932 
3689.
Sentence 38: if the polarity is  correct the platform will turn until the 
heading error angle is zero.
Sentence 39: 7.42571121752819 
3690.
Sentence 40: information is also available from this autocollimator system to 
set  the drift bias for the z-axis gyro.
Sentence 41:  7.492188089872309 
3691.
Sentence 42: if the z gyro  is drifting a current generated by the 
autocollimator is delivered to  the gyro torquer to cancel the drift.
  6.430558768088862 
3692.
Sentence 43: if the drift error is systematic it can be canceled with a bias 
circuit which can be arranged and adjusted  to supply the required 
compensating current.

Sentence 1: 3693.
Sentence 2: it is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which will 
indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction  and 
the platform.
Sentence 3:  8.601893869922396 
3694.
Sentence 4: essentially the stator or reference portion of  the pickoff is 
established with respect to the true heading direction  and the platform 
is turned either manually or automatically until the  angular 
electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero.
Sentence 5:  6.078010875628972 
3695.
Sentence 6: gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system  which 
depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading.

3696.
Sentence 7: for the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of three

3704.
Sentence 20: the sensing of this rotation by the x gyro can be utilized  to 
direct the platform into proper heading.

absolutely amazed.
Sentence 23:  6.860081853048783 
4206.
Sentence 24: this of course was  the sort of thing that used to take place in 
southern cities- putting  white houses of prostitution with colored 
girls in colored neighborhoods  and carrying them on openly.
 8.584740154993558 
4207.

  7.617733388754742

Sentence 36: for it is such a distinguished place with such fine works of art 
and  such a big library that there can be little doubt but that the 
owner has become depraved by all this culture.
Sentence 37:  8.089153168043826 
4683.
Sentence 38: to voltaire's surprise however their host gives them fresh clothes 
to put on opens his  purse to lend them money and sits them down before 
a good dinner.
Sentence 39:  5.56944066851265 
4684.
Sentence 40: immediately after dinner however rousseau asks for still another
  favor.
Sentence 41:  9.011757208240255 
4685.
Sentence 42: could he have pen and paper please?  8.261878609047885 
4686.
Sentence 43:  he is in a hurry  to write another essay against culture.
  16.763102424473505 
4687.
Sentence 44: such was the impromptu that voltaire gave to howls of laughter at 
sans souci and that was  soon circulated in manuscript throughout the 
literary circles of europe  to be printed sometime later but with the 
name of timon of athens  the famous misanthrope substituted for that 
of rousseau.
Sentence 45:  4.9157802803829505 
4688.
Sentence 46: how cruel!   but at the same time how understandable.
  18.027524893209772 
4689.
Sentence 47: how could  the rich for whom life was made so simple ever 
understand the subterfuges  the lies the frauds the errors sins and even 
crimes to  which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the 
great advantages the rich had in the race of life? 5.028920788314236 
4690.
Sentence 48:    how for example  could a voltaire understand the strange 
predicament in which a rousseau  would find himself when soon after the 
furor of his first discourse he acquired still another title to fame?
  7.244973523943356 
Sentence 1: 4691.
Sentence 2:    this time  as a musician.
Sentence 3:  12.995411607092887 
4692.
Sentence 4: ever since he had first begun  to study music and to teach it 
rousseau had dreamed of piercing through  to fame as the result of a 
successful opera.
Sentence 5:  8.533781942407167 
4693.
Sentence 6: but his facility in  this genre was not great.
  10.424285828111833 
4694.
Sentence 7: and his efforts to get a performance for his gallant muses 
invariably failed.
Sentence 8:  11.065566490591841 
4695.
Sentence 9: his  operatic music had little merit.
Sentence 10:  8.254441635698543 
4696.
Sentence 11: but then one day while on a week's visit to the country home of a 
retired swiss jeweler rousseau  amused the company with a few little 
melodies he had written to which  he attached no great importance.
  7.800205407488597 
4697.
Sentence 12: he was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about 
these delicate little songs.
Sentence 13: 7.3535919669018925 
4698.
Sentence 14: put a few such songs together they urged him.
  11.628774398523905 
4699.
Sentence 15: string them  onto some sort of little plot and you'll have a 
delightful operetta.
Sentence 16:  6.257543042178702 
4700.
Sentence 17: nonsense he said.
Sentence 18:  13.148092146312546 
4701.
Sentence 19: this is the sort of stuff i write and then throw away!   heaven
  forbid! cried the ladies enchanted by his music.
Sentence 20:  6.336654291461924 
4702.
Sentence 21: you  must make an opera out of this materia l.
  10.017072377839973 
4703.
Sentence 22: and they wouldn't  leave off arguing and pleading until he had 
promised.
Sentence 23:  8.602138872450183 
4704.
Sentence 24: oh  the irony and the bitterness of it! that after all his years 
of effort  to become a composer he should now now when he was still 
stoutly  replying to the critics of his discourse on the arts and 
sciences  be so close to a success in music and have to reject it.
  6.062264339481162 
4705.
Sentence 25: or at least appear to reject it!   but what else could he do?
  7.0146532207228125 
4706.
Sentence 26:   you couldn't on the one hand decry the arts and at the same 
time  practice them could you?  10.278409920367066 
4707.
Sentence 27:  well yes perhaps in literature since  you could argue that you 
couldn't keep silent about your feelings against  literature and so were 
involved in spite of yourself.
Sentence 28:  5.60059243696532 
4708.
Sentence 29: but now music  too?  28.39853014633006 
4709.
Sentence 30:  no.
Sentence 31: 15.610129252044759 
4710.
Sentence 32: that would be too much!   and the fault of  course was rameau's.
  11.850944746886343 
4711.
Sentence 33: the fault was rameau's and that of the whole culture of this 
parisian age.
Sentence 34:  7.949663754035088 
4712.
Sentence 35: for it was rameau's type of music that he had been trying to write 
and that he couldn't write.
Sentence 36: 12.36600500163518 
4713.
Sentence 37: these little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender
  memories of his childhood little melodies that anyone could hum and
  that would make one want to weep.
Sentence 38: 4.777091308850867 
4714.
Sentence 39: he couldn't appear  as a composer now.
Sentence 40:  10.649390503034523 
4715.
Sentence 41: that glory craved for so long was now forbidden  to him.
  7.7781193238568305 
4716.
Sentence 42: still just for the ladies and just for this once for this  one 
weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of his
  melodies.
Sentence 43:  7.650518612313837 
4717.
Sentence 44: the ladies were delighted and jean jacques was applauded.
  7.839212140222358 
4718.
Sentence 45: and everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote.
  8.889955146461821 
Sentence 1: 4719.
Sentence 2: but then after the little operetta had been given its feeble
  amateur rendering everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost
  forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the 
manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it 
merited.
Sentence 3:  6.231716108293974 
4720.
Sentence 4: rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite standing
  there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public 
performance.
Sentence 5:  7.492816382770513 
4721.
Sentence 6: the ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him.
  8.341215694113531 
4722.
Sentence 7: a contradiction? 21.944778634142413 
4723.
Sentence 8:  bah what was a contradiction in one's life? 7.083181512120244 
4724.
Sentence 9:   every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant 
yes  and saying yes when she meant no.
Sentence 10: 7.381174635157018 
4725.
Sentence 11: rousseau had to admit that  though he couldn't agree to a public 
performance he would indeed just for his own private satisfaction dearly 
love to know how his work  would sound when done by professional 
musicians and by trained voices.
Sentence 12:  4.897811242155384 
4726.
Sentence 13: i'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people  seem 
to think he said.
Sentence 14:  8.462872112817319 
4727.
Sentence 15: duclos the historian pointed  out to jean jacques that this was 
impossible.
Sentence 16: 6.8726567938239995 
4728.
Sentence 17: the musicians of the  royal opera would not rehearse a work merely 
to see how it would sound.
Sentence 18:  8.513265273755152 
4729.
Sentence 19: merely to satisfy the author's curiosity.
Sentence 20:  8.29907236975412 
4730.
Sentence 21: but he recalled that rameau had once had a private performance
  of his opera armide behind closed doors just for himself alone.
  8.720039788987915 
4731.
Sentence 22: duclos understood what was bothering rousseau: that the writer
  of the prosopopoeia of fabricius should now become known as the
  writer of an amusing little operetta.
Sentence 23:  4.808070905031883 
4732.
Sentence 24: that would certainly be paradoxical.
Sentence 25:  16.51465128084808 
4733.
Sentence 26: but duclos thought he saw a way out.
Sentence 27:  9.99670844734673 
4734.
Sentence 28: let me do the  submitting to the royal academy he suggested.
  10.77479865486041 
4735.
Sentence 29: your name will  never appear.
Sentence 30:  10.488068255839314 
4736.
Sentence 31: no one will even suspect that it is your work.
Sentence 32:  14.30958177424244 
4737.
Sentence 33: to that rousseau could agree.
Sentence 34:  11.129123680875907 
4738.
Sentence 35: but now what crazy twists  and turns of his emotions!   afraid at 
one and the same time that his work might be turned down- which would be 
a blow to his pride  even though no one knew he was the author- and 
that the work would  be accepted and then that his violent feelings in 
the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of 
himself.
Sentence 36:  7.900562692927515 
4739.
Sentence 37: and  how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause! and thus 
torn  between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful 
opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for 
anonymity  rousseau suffered through several painful weeks.
  5.293431582904382 
4740.
Sentence 38: all these  emotions were screwed up to new heights when after 
acceptance and  the first rehearsals there ensued such a buzz of 
excitement among parisian  music lovers that duclos had to come running 
to rousseau to  inform him that the news had reached the superintendent 
of the king's  amusements and that he was now demanding that the work 
be offered first at the royal summer palace of fontainebleau.
  6.10524828558552 
4741.
Sentence 39: imagine the honor  of it!   what was your answer?
  8.18553935110075 
4742.
Sentence 40:  jean jacques asked  striving to appear unimpressed.
  12.431590691442471 
Sentence 1: 4743.
Sentence 2: what else could i do? 11.591156920054853 
4744.
Sentence 3:  monsieur de cury was incensed of course.
Sentence 4:  9.060328853487057 
4745.
Sentence 5: but i said i would first have to get the author's permission.
  13.610507212250583 
4746.
Sentence 6: and i was certain he would refuse.
Sentence 7:  17.235246293149178 
4747.
Sentence 8: how infuriating all  this was! why had not this success come to 
him before he had plunged  into his discourse and before he had 
committed himself to a life of austerity and denial?  4.955389630163714 
4748.
Sentence 9:  now when everything was opening up to him- even the court of louis 
15!- he had to play a role of  self-effacement.
Sentence 10: 8.272651517777078 
4749.
Sentence 11: back and forth duclos had to go between m  de cury and jean 
jacques and between the duke d'aumont and jean  jacques again as his 
little operetta the village soothsayer though still unperformed took on 
ever more importance.
Sentence 12: 5.227211832857009 
4750.
Sentence 13: and  of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin 
to get  around among his closest friends.
Sentence 14: 6.808569519310805 
4751.
Sentence 15: but they naturally kept his secret  well and the public at large 
knew only of a great excitement in musical  and court circles.
  7.015249009362936 
4752.
Sentence 16: how titillating it was to go among people  who did not know him 
as the composer but who talked in the most  glowing terms of the promise 
of the piece after having heard the first  rehearsals.
Sentence 17: 8.135915446994483 
4753.
Sentence 18: the furor was such that people who could not possibly have
  squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they 
were  intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational.
  8.461151369422783 
4754.
Sentence 19: and  listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a 
cup of  chocolate in a cafe rousseau found himself bathed in 
perspiration  trembling lest his authorship become known and at the 
same time dreaming  of the startling effect he would make if he should 
proclaim himself suddenly as the composer.
Sentence 20:  6.32719733088611 
4755.
Sentence 21: he felt himself now as he himself says in his confessions at a 
crucial point of his life.
Sentence 22:  6.607741319023334 
4756.
Sentence 23: and that  was why on the day of the performance when a carriage 
from the royal  stables called to take him to the palace he did not 
bother to shave.
Sentence 24: 10.008590622866036 
4757.
Sentence 25: on the contrary he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of
  several days.
Sentence 26:  8.980433415237409 
4758.
Sentence 27: seeing him in that condition and about to enter  the hall where 
the king the queen the whole royal family and all  the members of the 
highest aristocracy would be present grimm and the abbe raynal and others 
tried to stop him.
Sentence 28:  6.097434206363047 
4759.
Sentence 29: you can't  go in that way! they cried.
Sentence 30: 10.644218033232553 
4760.
Sentence 31: why not?  23.24179106238561 
4761.
Sentence 32:  jean jacques  asked.
Sentence 33:  18.68272446118427 
4762.
Sentence 34: who is going to stop me?  20.544513394053585 
4763.
Sentence 35:    you haven't dressed for the occasion! they pointed out to him.
  10.410372198890153 
4764.
Sentence 36: i'm  dressed as i always am rousseau said.
Sentence 37:  9.060328853487057 
4765.
Sentence 38: at home yes they argued.
Sentence 39:  12.498485635082105 
4766.
Sentence 40: but here you are in the palace.
Sentence 41:  14.306364280244424 
4767.
Sentence 42: and madame de pompadour.
Sentence 43:  13.192167111495898 
4768.
Sentence 44: if they are here then surely i have the right to be here
  rousseau said.
Sentence 45:  14.396666965339293 
4769.
Sentence 46: since i am the composer!  but in such a slovenly condition.
  8.782024044526025 
4770.
Sentence 47: what is slovenly about me? 11.78959997873465 
4771.
Sentence 48:  rousseau asked.
Sentence 49: 12.292407525564322 
4772.
Sentence 50: is it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face?
  11.55506159839746 
Sentence 1: 4773.
Sentence 2:  surely it would grow there whether  i washed myself or not.
  6.572783333480499 
4774.
Sentence 3: a hundred years ago i would have worn  a beard with pride.
  12.139134374908117 
4775.
Sentence 4: and those without beards would have stood out as  not dressed for 
the occasion.
Sentence 5:  7.156917291557286 
4776.
Sentence 6: now times have changed and i must pretend  that hair doesn't grow 
on my face.
Sentence 7: 8.405009070216412 
4777.
Sentence 8: and  fashion is the real king here.
Sentence 9:  8.181297206969163 
4778.
Sentence 10: not louis 15 since even he obeys.
Sentence 11: 11.606791343011063 
4779.
Sentence 12: now if you don't mind i should like to hear my own piece performed.
  5.725458603114982 
4780.
Sentence 13: but of course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold  at all.
  9.887008010130634 
4781.
Sentence 14: he trembled lest his piece should fail.
Sentence 15:  9.783357976961607 
4782.
Sentence 16: and this in addition  to his usual fear of being among people of 
high society.
Sentence 17:  9.859361814520655 
4783.
Sentence 18: his fear  of making some inane or inappropriate remark.
  7.591810951946381 
4784.
Sentence 19: and even deeper than  that: his fear lest in this closed hall he 
should suddenly itch to  relieve himself.
Sentence 20: 8.311536384923809 
4785.
Sentence 21: could he walk out in the midst of his piece? 10.923668848968132 
4786.
Sentence 22:  here before the court?  13.148092146312546 
4787.
Sentence 23:  before the king?  19.09659708171543 
4788.
Sentence 24:   it was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning 
began.
Sentence 25:  10.195575129328692 
4789.
Sentence 26: the rider from concord was as good as his word.
Sentence 27:  9.112598594729707 
4790.
Sentence 28: he came spurring and whooping down the road his horse kicking up 
clouds of dust  shouting:   they're a-coming! by god they're a-coming
  they are!   we heard him before he ever showed and we  heard him 
yelling after he was out of sight.
Sentence 29:  6.960245054825023 
4791.
Sentence 30: solomon chandler hadn't  misjudged the strength of his lungs not 
at all.
Sentence 31:  6.771690794857863 
4792.
Sentence 32: i think you could  have heard him a mile away and he was 
bursting at every seam with importance.
Sentence 33: 0.0 
4793.
Sentence 34: i have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole
  character of a man and when a very small man is up on a saddle he'd
  like as not prefer to eat his meals there.
Sentence 35:  6.389333468030404 
4794.
Sentence 36: that's understandable and i appreciate the sentiment.
  5.092274000697261 
4795.
Sentence 37: as for this rider i never saw  him before or afterwards and 
never saw him dismounted so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes i 
can't say; but i do know that  he gave the day tone and distinction.
  5.364940998037396 
4796.
Sentence 38: the last thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of 
farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone wall 
and this dashing rider made us feel  a good deal sharper and more 
alert to the situation.
Sentence 39:  7.496148529638275 
4797.
Sentence 40: we came  down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us and we 
crouched behind it.
Sentence 41:  9.564332874213168 
4798.
Sentence 42: i have heard people talk with contempt about the british regulars
  but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of
  which they are deplorably ignorant.
Sentence 43:  7.942138480299418 
4799.
Sentence 44: whatever we felt about the redcoats  we respected them in terms 
of their trade which was killing; and  i know that i myself was 
nauseated with apprehension and fear and  that my hands were soaking 
wet where they held my gun.
Sentence 45: 5.191878549365918 
4800.
Sentence 46: i wanted to wipe my flint but i didn't dare to the state my hands 
were in just  as i didn't dare to do anything about the priming.
  9.437068479917283 
Sentence 1: 4801.
Sentence 2: the gun would  fire or not just as chance willed.
  7.839212140222358 
4802.
Sentence 3: i put a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun because the 
most important thing i had learned  about war was that you could run 
away and survive to talk about it.
Sentence 4:  7.7479487019052895 
4803.
Sentence 5: the gunfire which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the
  road now stopped for long enough to count to twenty; and in that
  brief interval a redcoat officer came tearing down the road whipping
  his horse fit to kill.
Sentence 6: 4.662152275130837 
4804.
Sentence 7: i don't know whether he was after our rider  who had gone by a 
minute before or whether he was simply scouting conditions;  but when he 
passed us by a musket roared and he reared his  horse swung it around 
and began to whip it back in the direction  from which he had come.
  5.627731404648714 
4805.
Sentence 8: he was a fine and showy rider but his skill  was wasted on us.
  8.833266063919373 
4806.
Sentence 9: from above me and somewhere behind me a rifle cracked.
  10.062957891703219 
4807.
Sentence 10: the redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster and the

  knew it not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the 
Sentence 1: church-  his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his 
career-  but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the 
colonel.
Sentence 2:  6.1723191090570575 
6011.
Sentence 3: he  was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion

  7.99209079454377 
6017.

  of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly 
or  whether hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the 
print shop using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse.
Sentence 14:  4.654322151995442 
6018.

Sentence 24: it was a ridiculous situation  and rector knew it for hino 
frankly partisan openly gregarious  would make a poor espionage 
agent.

6024.
Sentence 26: if he wanted to know anything he would end up asking about it 
point-blank but in this guileless manner  he would probably receive 
more truthful answers than if he tried to  get them by indirection.
  7.516771564358079 
6025.
Sentence 27: in all of his experience in the mission field  rector had never 
seen a convert quite like hino.
Sentence 28:  10.70843057972297 
6026.
Sentence 29: from the moment that hino had first walked into the mission to ask 
for a job any job-  his qualifications neatly written on a piece of 
paper in a precise  hand- he had been ready to become a christian.

outlines of a biography.

in  chiba and divided his life between the land and the sea 
supplementing  the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with 
seasonal employment  on a fishing boat.
Sentence 3:  5.159051802320863 
6032.
Sentence 4: without exception hino's brothers turned  to either one or both 
of their father's occupations but hino showed  a talent for neither 
and instead spent most of his time on the beach  where he repaired nets 
and proved immensely popular as a storyteller.
Sentence 5:  7.048662339813435 
6033.
Sentence 6: he had gone into the japanese navy had been trained as an officer
  had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail
  regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five
  quite as a bolt out of the blue he had walked into the mission as 
if  he belonged here and had become a christian.
Sentence 7: 6.398377394953877 
6034.

do so unasked.
Sentence 11:  9.36313086480133 
6036.
Sentence 12: rector had no doubt that hino would come back from the village
  bursting with information ready to impart it with his customary 
gusto liberally embellished with his active imagnation.
Sentence 13:  6.74112264670777 
6037.
Sentence 14: when the telephone  rang on the day after hino went down to the 
village rector had  a hunch it would be hino with some morsel of 
information too important  to wait until his return for there were few 
telephones in the village  and the phone in rector's office rarely rang 
unless it was important.
Sentence 15:  5.369708241574286 
6038.
Sentence 16: he was surprised to find kayabashi's secretary on the other  end

6040.

said businessmen from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi  wished to

6041.
Sentence 21: they had never seen one before  and had expressed a curiosity 
about it.
Sentence 22:  8.79326306085581

Sentence 24:  15.140397752418034 
6043.

  8.872935817204608 
6046.
Sentence 29: i will  be expecting them.
Sentence 30:  18.694724422724896 
6047.
Sentence 31: he was about to hang up the phone but  a note of hesitancy in the 
secretary's voice left the conversation open.

in rector's hand.

6052.
Sentence 40: rector had no idea why kayabashi wanted to visit the mission.
  8.61349622982108 
6053.
Sentence 41: for the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great
  weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all
  the available information it was probably the latter.
  5.872743400974493 
Sentence 1: 6054.
Sentence 2: kayabashi must  feel fairly certain of his victory in order to 
make a visit like this a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by 
the people in the  village.

  16.095592040991242 
6065.
Sentence 18: why? 15.610129252044759 
6066.

said he explained about  the visit and the effect he wished to create 
the picture of a very busy  mission.
Sentence 20:  8.623605076921264 
6067.
Sentence 21: he did not wish to deceive kayabashi exactly just to display the 
mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner.

6068.

6076.

6077.

Sentence 41:  12.95154123597628 
6078.
Sentence 42: i would  like them to appear very busy today not busy exactly but 
joyous exuberant full of life.
Sentence 43:  8.237409910283183 
6079.

6084.
Sentence 52: i think i've fixed the pump so we won't have to worry about it for 
a long time he said.
Sentence 53:  14.135809511476369 
6085.

not the easiest thing in the world to find good  homes for kittens- and 
damn it you know very well if i have them  around long impossible to 
give them away! and i suppose now that you've finally grown up if a

Sentence 28:  7.125955597219856 
8403.
Sentence 29: but then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best cold it 
was all but undrinkable-  especially that cup!   she was deeply 
horribly sure  that lucien had filled it with opium.
  5.8492545957946644 
8404.
Sentence 30: she had quarreled with lucien  she had resisted his demands for 
money- and if she died by the provisions  of her marriage contract 
lucien would inherit legally not  only the immediate sum of gold under 
the floorboards in the office but later when the war was over her 
father's entire estate.
Sentence 31:  6.500029345007494 
8405.
Sentence 32: she  felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time.
  7.26104304359843 
8406.

the only person  in this house who could have put opium in that coffee.
  7.424866357058852 
8407.
Sentence 34: she  had lost a bottle of opium- but that was on the trip from new

Sentence 39: rilly or glendora had entered her room while she slept bringing 
back her washed clothes.
Sentence 40:  7.032105024464237 
8411.
Sentence 41: so somebody else could have come in too- then or later while she was 
out of the room.
Sentence 42: 7.699557171210962 
8412.
Sentence 43: it  would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor.
  7.6924205076212635 
8413.
Sentence 44: it was  not very reasonable to believe that lucien had procured 
unprocurable  opium and come back to honotassa with a formed plan to 
murder her.
Sentence 45: 6.526896965308186 
8414.
Sentence 46: he  didn't even know that she was there.
Sentence 47:  10.648531049792185 
8415.
Sentence 48: and he certainly couldn't  have guessed that she would resist his 
demand for the gold or that she  was not the yielding- yes and credible 
fool he had every right to  expect.
Sentence 49:  5.743742669551544 
8416.
Sentence 50: no he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised.
  11.344530025335501 
8417.
Sentence 51: then somebody else?  14.43160455482214 
Sentence 1: 8418.
Sentence 2:  don't question rev had said don't  invite danger.
  4.270701532995561 
8419.
Sentence 3: her skin crawled: lolotte had told maude that  she was in the 
hall and the door was open.
Sentence 4: 6.254122446453258 
8420.
Sentence 5: sarah had begun to tell  lucien of emile she had begun to 
question and a little draft had crept  across the room from the bedroom 
door open barely enough to show  a rim of blackness in the hall.
  6.075970599553096 
8421.
Sentence 6: so lolotte- or anybody- could have  listened and that somebody 
could have already been supplied with  the missing bottle of opium.
  5.983463794619069 
8422.
Sentence 7: that was not reasonable either.
Sentence 8:  22.836070195266753 
8423.
Sentence 9: the opium had disappeared before emile's death and whoever shot him
  could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen sarah's
  own doubts and suspicions- and questions.
Sentence 10:  5.704609165304231 
8424.
Sentence 11: she began to doubt  whether there had been in fact a lethal dose 
of opium in the cup.
Sentence 12:  9.714154428711911 
8425.
Sentence 13: so  suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would 
leave honotassa! that made a certain amount of logic.
Sentence 14:  5.15576524365156 
8426.
Sentence 15: added to the  argument was the fact that while she might have 
tasted the coffee if it  had been still hot she might even have drunk 
some of it she wouldn't  have taken enough to kill her for she would 
have been warned by  its taste.
Sentence 16: 6.336437769264723 
8427.
Sentence 17: it was merely an attempt to frighten her.
Sentence 18:  14.46262503352129 
8428.
Sentence 19: she wouldn't go back to new york as maude suggested; she wouldn't
  run like a scared cat.
Sentence 20: 10.044378826341275 
8429.
Sentence 21: but- well she'd be very careful.
Sentence 22: 7.622507342753323 
8430.
Sentence 23: she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense
  of normal everyday life.
Sentence 24:  8.171394947443085 
8431.
Sentence 25: but before she left her room she dug  into her big moire bag took 
out the envelope holding her marriage contract  and the wax seal had 
been broken.
Sentence 26:  5.46911413810475 
8432.
Sentence 27: so somebody else knew what  would happen to her father's money if 
she died.
Sentence 28:  8.330529772257353 
8433.
Sentence 29: rev had known  all along.
Sentence 30: 9.118533821976325 
8434.
Sentence 31: rev didn't need to break the wax seal read the contract and find 
out.
Sentence 32:  7.198778874655976 
8435.
Sentence 33: he could conceivably have wished to make sure; rev loved honotassa 
it was like a part of his breath and body; rev  had stressed the need 
for money.
Sentence 34: 8.13063622690684 
8436.
Sentence 35: rev would never have tried to give her poison!   she thrust the 
envelope back in the bag; there  was no point in locking it up in the 
armoire now it was like locking  the barn after the horse was stolen.
  7.4607387446924 
8437.
Sentence 36: and in all likelihood by now  there was more than one person in 
the house who knew the terms of her  marriage contract.
  10.556055018280114 
8438.
Sentence 37: there was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd 
been.
Sentence 38: 13.125676935851551 
8439.
Sentence 39: she went downstairs and received another  curious shock for when 
glendora flapped into the dining room in  her homemade moccasins sarah 
asked her when she had brought coffee  to her room and glendora said she 
hadn't.
Sentence 40:  5.286153820897227 
8440.
Sentence 41: too much work this morning  miss sarah- everybody gone like that-   
sarah swallowed  past another kind of constriction in her throat.
  8.19458779820395 
8441.
Sentence 42: well then  who brought it?  12.076792408766652 
8442.
Sentence 43:    miss maude.
Sentence 44:  20.11034579016859

8446.
Sentence 6: i don't know what we're  going to do miss sarah.
  5.695623658910755 
8447.
Sentence 7: we've got to eat sarah said curtly because a chill crawled over her 
again.
Sentence 8:  4.635617967570337 
8448.
Sentence 9: the rice wasn't dosed with opium indeed it had no taste at all not 
a grain of salt.
Sentence 10: 7.735484842834032 
8449.
Sentence 11: she ate what she could and went out along the covered passageway

with her through the drizzle to the storehouse.

Sentence 21:  8.581436094141479 
8455.
Sentence 22: it was a long low room like a root cellar for it was banked up 
with soil and vines  had run rampant over that too.

of dried peas eggs cornmeal a little salt.
Sentence 27: 5.236383152695367 
8458.
Sentence 28: the shelves looked emptier than  when miss celie had shown her the 
storeroom and since the men from  the commissary had called; there were 
certainly now fewer mouths  to feed but there was less to feed them with.
  6.920920809041023 
8459.
Sentence 29: she took glendora to  the smokehouse unlocked it and saw with

Sentence 43: 9.336189346519962

her mind to do.

her.
Sentence 48:  7.187557404882245 
8470.

childish about an attempt to frighten her.
Sentence 50:  8.065136868315244 
8471.
Sentence 51: maude was neither hysterical nor silly and sarah rather doubted if 
she  had ever  been childish.

join him never expecting  her to accept.

8657.

  10.068881193379493

going to be a cinch.
Sentence 4:  12.0856416382172 
8683.
Sentence 5: we'd know him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear twined
  in his hair.
Sentence 6:  5.7458677294699

Sentence 11: by the time felix turned up it was early afternoon which one would 
think would be late enough so that by then except for small children
  and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up it could have
  been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of 
active  interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats.
  6.450508962282604 
8687.

  something is cooking and that your house has passed under this 
unaccountable  official control could you go on forgetting that you 
still had  that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying 
that childish  horn in your hand?  4.7020893957538235 
8712.
Sentence 14:    what i'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for felix's

smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his 
thirties handclasp too consciously quick and firm.
Sentence 8: 6.582752729917001 
9317.
Sentence 9: youngish man on the make madden labeled him and was ready  to 
guess that in a correct not too pushing fashion the junior partner  of 
the firm had political ambitions; that mrs garth would be  impeccably 
suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer; that there  were three 
children two boys and a girl; that she was active in the woman's club and 
he in lions rotary and jaycee; and finally  that neither of them had 
harbored an unorthodox opinion since their  wedding day.
  4.563488926618623

  obviously still a functioning town house and its owners were in 
residence; that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans

  prized open.

9517.
Sentence 29: it had been shut again but the lock was broken; he noted  with

raised; he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to 
the sill.
Sentence 43:  5.260267474524373 
9526.
Sentence 44: he turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly 
back  to the window and his rifle sight dismissing hoag for the moment

9671.

  of hours he did not think to look and see if jerry burton's  car 
was still there.
Sentence 35: 6.178311412935174 
9672.
Sentence 36: in fact he did not think about jerry burton at  all until he 
entered his living room and closed the door behind him.

  empty did he remember his earlier problem.
Sentence 39:  5.7104115345172275

that he had spread over  burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top 
of it.

disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof.

drinks to burton and then returned  to the kitchen to get weaker 
drinks for himself.
Sentence 3:  6.081676676833635 
9682.
Sentence 4: for another  second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was 
directed at himself;  then his mind moved on to be confronted by 
something far more  serious and as the thought expanded the 
implications jarred him.
Sentence 5:  6.721177813726227 
9683.
Sentence 6: it  no longer mattered that burton had outsmarted him.
  6.764147616291221 
9684.
Sentence 7: the important thing  was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a 
blackmailer with a gun in his pocket.
Sentence 8:  8.175607234186513 
9685.
Sentence 9: and that gun was empty.
Sentence 10:  16.26905287195387 
9686.
Sentence 11: even before his mind  had rounded out the idea he thrust one hand 
into his trousers pocket  and pulled out the six slugs he had taken 
from the revolver.
Sentence 12:  7.713014303320637 
9687.
Sentence 13: he considered  them with brooding eyes brows bunched as his brain 
grappled with  the problem and tried to find some solution.

Sentence 19:  how can i find him?  13.798694057385854 
9692.
Sentence 20:    there was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth 
across the room his  imagination out of control.
Sentence 21: 11.822757104647204 
9693.
Sentence 22: he tried to tell himself that maybe burton  had sobered up enough 
to get some sense.
Sentence 23:  8.818807756068935 
9694.
Sentence 24: maybe he only intended to  scare the blackmailer whoever he was in 
which case an unloaded gun  would be good enough.
Sentence 25: 8.594528182897653 
9695.
Sentence 26: he thought of other possibilities none of them  satisfactory and 
finally he began to think to wonder if there was  some way he could 
reach burton.
Sentence 27:  6.418600809631403 
9696.
Sentence 28: then as he turned toward the telephone it rang shrilly to shatter 
the stillness in the room and he reached  for it eagerly.

9699.
Sentence 33: when he heard calenda say: what about that picture you took  this

9703.
Sentence 39:    one of my boys.
Sentence 40:  29.120826228793916 
9704.

close at hand.

Sentence 48: 8.581436094141479 
9709.
Sentence 49: under normal circumstances casey was a little fussy when people 
told  him what to do with pictures he had taken.
Sentence 50:  7.711678106143414 
9710.

those who voiced their objections properly.
Sentence 52:  10.862515415720477 
Sentence 1: 9711.
Sentence 2: right now however he was still too worried about jerry  burton and 
the gun that had no bullets and the story burton had told  him to care 
too much about tony calenda.

9712.

Sentence 7:  13.515423079641023

Sentence 8: that's all i know about it and that's all i care.
Sentence 9: 5.446579851310273 
9715.
Sentence 10: maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what i said.
  6.338907635937182 
9716.
Sentence 11: all right calenda said his voice still quiet.
  11.369735003123072 
9717.
Sentence 12: but i meant what i said casey.
Sentence 13:  12.800672623818418

Sentence 31:  7.136059644574391 
9730.
Sentence 32: he casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from
  the fact that he felt responsible.

Sentence 34: he should have stayed here and  watched burton.
  10.629729299791055

Sentence 35: so he made a mistake.
Sentence 36: 21.517988580556814

him and wanted to give him a break.
Sentence 10:  6.732941992237565 
9750.
Sentence 11: only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony and like the police

9753.
Sentence 17: he did not bother with his radio- there would be time  for that 
later- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the  filling

9754.
Sentence 19: the police car had pulled up behind a  small sedan its headlights

 at  little more than a crawl and watched elaine rapidly spin from

chart.
Sentence 22:  4.6986338168856925 
9756.

Sentence 33: the rock and roll music coming from the radio  station suddenly

Sentence 35: reverse elaine said then peered through the loop  of the rdf and 
waved to poet.
Sentence 36:  5.542917982132687 
9764.

9765.
Sentence 39: she cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on  the 
end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the
  cockpit faced toward the shore.
Sentence 40:  5.323212874448376 
9766.
Sentence 41: nick watched her somewhat enviously as she efficiently cut the 
engines and started the auxiliary motor.
Sentence 42:  7.20145901369959 
9767.
Sentence 43: poet came up from below wearing new bathing trunks.
  6.460370037324521 
9768.
Sentence 44: the price  tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he 
entered the chartroom and looked at it curiously.
Sentence 45: 8.35195770629959 
9769.
Sentence 46: nick wondered if elaine had bought them  but he said nothing.
  6.210871206873012 
9770.
Sentence 47: nobody he suddenly realized was saying anything.
  10.694117775472467

below them was a treasure  lost for more than four hundred years.

finder.
Sentence 4:  7.407038838449361 
9774.
Sentence 5: once in new  york he had gone flying with some friends in a 
small private airplane with a single engine.

Sentence 11: all had fallen into a complete silence listening to the wind 
whistle  over the wings.

Sentence 13: the pilot had been good.
Sentence 14:  14.717419125242657 
9779.
Sentence 15: he'd landed the plane on a small airstrip in connecticut and as 
soon as the aircraft had  coasted to a stop everyone had burst into 
chatter at the same moment.
Sentence 16: 5.918556538736704 
9780.
Sentence 17: there had been tension in the plane during the silent descent;
  a tension similar to the one now.
Sentence 18: 10.422266469928877 
9781.
Sentence 19: but in the plane there was a concrete  reason for i t.
  13.125732762028516 
9782.
Sentence 20: now at this moment there should be none h unless  skin diving was 
much more dangerous than he had been led to believe.
Sentence 21:  9.10708203153312 
9783.
Sentence 22: the same taut-nerved relationship as there  had been between the 
passengers on the plane now strained at the three  of them here on the 
boat.
Sentence 23: 6.146509968909198 
9784.
Sentence 24: it hung over them like a cloud its arrival  as sudden as a cloud 
skidding over the sun.

9785.
Sentence 26: silently elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out 
into the cockpit poet behind her nick trailing behind him.

padlock on the chest beneath it then  presently straightened holding a

9787.
Sentence 29: poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun.
Sentence 30:  6.968746590851131 
9788.
Sentence 31: they are the  best.

9789.
Sentence 33: she kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion.
  7.533469760296565 
9790.
Sentence 34: they are the most efficient.
Sentence 35: 26.045838823219967 
9791.
Sentence 36: and the deadliest poet commented as he buckled on his tank harness.
  8.3115201837941 
9792.
Sentence 37: why do you need an arsenal? 13.663388853342104 
9793.
Sentence 38:  nick asked apprehensively staring at the weapon.
Sentence 39: 7.14162538120728 
9794.
Sentence 40: it's quite possible there's more than codfish down there man poet 
replied with a short nervous laugh as he held  the harness for 
elaine.
Sentence 41:  4.6855296205937185 
9795.
Sentence 42: a moment later moving awkwardly because  of the swimming fins 
she picked up the gun handed the knife to poet  then rolled off the 
transom of the boat back first.

9796.
Sentence 44: poet nodded  to nick and entered the water in a similar 
fashion.
Sentence 45:  8.149408063313643 
9797.
Sentence 46: another moment  and they were out of sight leaving behind only a 
string of bubbles as  a clue to their whereabouts.
Sentence 47:  0.0 
9798.
Sentence 48: for a while nick followed the  twisting course of the bubbles 
wondering which set came from elaine.
Sentence 49:  10.746666733896244 
9799.
Sentence 50: they remained close together their air trail wiggling like serpents
  traveling side by side.
Sentence 51:  6.793852307633501 
9800.
Sentence 52: eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle of the ocean 
surface and he rolled over on his back.
Sentence 53: 7.703336839382465 
9801.
Sentence 54: clasping  his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky.
  6.002446559592496 
Sentence 1: 9802.
Sentence 2: there was  nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean.
  11.065775357961698 
9803.
Sentence 3: alfredo certainly  must have enjoyed being alone.
  7.622507342753323 
9804.
Sentence 4: next to the ocean probably the  loneliest spot was the desert.
  12.326874534722377 
9805.
Sentence 5: if elaine's uncle had stuck to this  desire for aloneness he 
probably would still be alive.
Sentence 6:  7.288703696461154 
9806.
Sentence 7: yet alfredo  wanted money h wanted money to roam through the 
deserts.
Sentence 8:  8.783628152824377 
9807.

9853.
Sentence 40:  she asked steadily.
Sentence 41:  23.0547882925987

Sentence 26: but mary  would soon no longer be living there for she would be 
notified in a  few days that her husband had died in an accident while 
on a flight to tahiti.
Sentence 27:  5.599908064302229 
10820.
Sentence 28: she would weep in private he was sure for she loved him  in 
her frigid way though in public she would be dry-eyed.
Sentence 29:  7.383559575995673 
10821.
Sentence 30: her friends  and professional associates would sympathize with 
her not because she  had lost a beloved husband but because she had 
been married to a man who thought unrealistically.
Sentence 31: 5.202300107616343 
10822.
Sentence 32: if hal yarrow had been killed in a  crash he must have wanted it 
that way.
Sentence 33:  9.216615257228089 
10823.
Sentence 34: there was no such thing as an  accident.
Sentence 35:  31.51399156488887 
10824.
Sentence 36: somehow all the other passengers have died in this web of 
elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance  had simultaneously 
agreed  to die.
Sentence 37:  7.399997117206211 
10825.
Sentence 38: and therefore being in disgrace they would not be cremated  and 
their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony.
Sentence 39: 6.63161347574479 
10826.
Sentence 40: no the fish  could eat their bodies for all the sturch cared.
  10.049405630952123 
10827.
Sentence 41: hal felt  sorry for mary; he had a time keeping the tears from 
welling to his  own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation 
dome.
Sentence 42: 5.571891459712226 
10828.
Sentence 43: yet he told himself this was the best way.
Sentence 44: 11.45981022323534 
Sentence 1: 10829.
Sentence 2: he and mary would no longer  have to tear and rend at each

Sentence 6: she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose  a 
mate from a list selected by her gapt.
Sentence 7: 7.356479223090401 
10832.
Sentence 8: perhaps the psychological  barriers that had prevented her from 
conceiving hal's child would no longer be present.
Sentence 9: 8.645068462809599 
10833.
Sentence 10: hal doubted if this happy event would occur.
Sentence 11:  7.14162538120728

Sentence 19: there was the squat loose-jowled man smiling lopsidedly  up at 
him.
Sentence 20:  16.83937934090461

  7.095994055561842 
10840.
Sentence 22: i had no idea that you too would be on this glorious  voyage.
  11.005023618795416

Sentence 23: but i might have known! we seem to be bound by love;  sigmen 
himself must have foreseen it.

10842.
Sentence 25: love to you my ward.
Sentence 26: 10.983477020546593

Sentence 32: the gabriel pointed  towards her destination and under one-gee 
acceleration began to build up towards her ultimate velocity 99.
  7.48837548295765 
10847.
Sentence 33: 1 percent of the speed of light.
Sentence 34: 12.21476784965131 
10848.
Sentence 35: meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out
  the performance of the ship went into the suspensor.
  7.2824623277407525 
10849.
Sentence 36: here they would lie in suspended animation for many years.
  9.541021300868657 
10850.
Sentence 37: some time later after a check had been made of all automatic 
equipment the crew would join  the others.
Sentence 38: 9.952496417846513 
10851.
Sentence 39: they would sleep while the gabriel's drive would increase  the 
acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could 
not have endured.
Sentence 40:  6.463467907489391 
10852.
Sentence 41: upon reaching the desired speed the  automatic equipment would 
cut off the drive and the silent but not empty  vessel would hurl 
towards the star which was its journey's end.
Sentence 42:  6.350370199731661 
10853.
Sentence 43: many years later the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of
  the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate 
deceleration.
Sentence 44:  6.345892447065436 
10854.
Sentence 45: again a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be 
applied.
Sentence 46:  8.363747787044698 
10855.
Sentence 47: then after slowing the vessel considerably the drive  would 
adjust to a one-gee deceleration.
Sentence 48: 6.679996801724873 
10856.
Sentence 49: and the crew would be automatically  brought out of their 
suspended animation.
Sentence 50:  11.407704029517989 
10857.
Sentence 51: these members would  then unthaw the rest of the personnel.
  10.78959546031297 
Sentence 1: 10858.
Sentence 2: and in the half-year left  before reaching their destination the 
men would carry out whatever preparations were needed.
  10.125848877460767 
10859.
Sentence 3: hal yarrow was among the last to go  into the suspensor and among 
the first to come out.
Sentence 4: 6.6133398397231105 
10860.
Sentence 5: he had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation 
of ozagen siddo.
Sentence 6: 13.174267852371106 
10861.
Sentence 7: and from the first he faced a difficult task.
Sentence 8:  11.4822246633842 
10862.
Sentence 9: the expedition that  had discovered ozagen had succeeded in 
correlating two thousand siddo  words with an equal number of american 
words.
Sentence 10:  7.89731643363319 
10863.
Sentence 11: the description of  the siddo syntax was very restricted.
  8.341215694113531 
10864.
Sentence 12: and as hal found out obviously  mistaken in many cases.
  12.33523252385319 
10865.
Sentence 13: this discovery caused hal anxiety.
Sentence 14:  11.309843967689007 
10866.
Sentence 15: his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire 
personnel  of the gabriel how to speak ozagen.
Sentence 16:  8.10870657293274 
10867.
Sentence 17: yet if he used all of the  little means at his disposal he would 
be instructing his students wrongly.
Sentence 18:  6.623002916648006 
10868.
Sentence 19: moreover even getting this across would be difficult.
  10.514280166105873 
10869.
Sentence 20: for one thing the organs of speech of the ozagen natives differed
  somewhat from earthmen's; the sounds made by these organs were
  therefore dissimilar.
Sentence 21: 7.246196728979406 
10870.
Sentence 22: it was true that they could be approximated but would the 
ozagenians understand these approximations?  13.513578749536904 
10871.
Sentence 23:    another  obstacle was the grammatical construction of 
siddo.
Sentence 24:  7.14162538120728 
10872.
Sentence 25: instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached  particle to 
indicate the past or future siddo used an entirely different  word.
  8.97061060664233 
10873.
Sentence 26: thus the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai
  meaning to live was in the perfect tense ksu'u'peli'afo and in the 
future mai'teipa.
Sentence 27:  7.490544664083626 
10874.
Sentence 28: the same use of an entirely different word applied for all the 
other tenses.
Sentence 29:  11.74086542457542 
10875.
Sentence 30: plus the  fact that siddo not only had the normal three genders
  of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and
  spiritual.
Sentence 31: 4.903693293796623 
10876.
Sentence 32: fortunately gender was inflected though the expression of it would 
be difficult for anybody not born in siddo.
Sentence 33:  7.738106859483177 
10877.
Sentence 34: the system  of indicating gender varied according to tense.
  8.341215694113531 
10878.
Sentence 35: all the other  parts of speech: nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs 
and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs.
  7.98292226510367 
10879.
Sentence 36: this was not for the angel just a matter of running through a 
logical or deductive chain or deciding on some action from some 
already  established premise.
Sentence 37:  6.783491024342418 
10880.
Sentence 38: no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing  as fast as any 
computer.
Sentence 39:  11.113688151867496 
10881.
Sentence 40: what gabriel was being asked to do  now however was to re-
examine all his basic assumptions make value-judgments  on them and give 
them new and different powers in his mind  to govern his motives.
  5.139461289280905 
10882.
Sentence 41: this is not wholly a reasoning process- a computer  cannot do 
it all- and even in an angel it takes time.
Sentence 42:  10.850633196868232 
Sentence 1: 10883.
Sentence 2: perhaps especially in an angel whose assumptions had mostly been
  being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause however did 
not make it seem any less long  to jack.
Sentence 3:  5.623452495899517 
10884.
Sentence 4: he had already become used to hesperus' snapping back answers
  to questions almost before jack could get them asked.
  8.725284242937896 
10885.
Sentence 5: there  was nothing he could do but wait.
Sentence 6: 8.923219809040408 
10886.
Sentence 7: at  last gabriel spoke.
Sentence 8:  13.148092146312546 
10887.
Sentence 9: we misjudged you he said slowly.
Sentence 10: 10.717432709549398 
10888.
Sentence 11: we had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had
  time to develop a sense of justice.
Sentence 12:  9.411182198381992 
10889.
Sentence 13: of course we have before us the example of the great races at the 
galactic center; individually they  are nearly as mortal as you- the 
difference does not seem very marked  to us where it exists.
  5.808033151720827 
10890.
Sentence 14: but they have survived for long periods as  races whereas you are 
young.
Sentence 15:  12.35026672032372 
10891.
Sentence 16: we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by 
half.
Sentence 17: 7.970495892540978 
10892.
Sentence 18: for now it is clear  that we were in the wrong.
  12.372623381612586 
10893.
Sentence 19: you may reclaim your property and the penalty on hesperus is 
lifted.
Sentence 20:  9.242266870568722 
10894.
Sentence 21: i  did not perceive this essential distinction either first-born
  hesperus said at once i was only practicing a concept that jack
  taught me called a deal.
Sentence 22:  6.602504042024367 
10895.
Sentence 23: nevertheless you were its  agent.
Sentence 24:  11.11483049001212 
10896.
Sentence 25: jack what is the nature of this concept?  13.86513856163982 
10897.
Sentence 26:    it's  a kind of agreement in which each party gives something 
to the other  jack said.
Sentence 27: 5.542917982132687 
10898.
Sentence 28: we regard it as fair only when each party feels  that what he has 
received is as valuable or more valuable than what he has given.
  6.889256769405176 
10899.
Sentence 29: his heart he discovered was pounding.
Sentence 30: 9.235400264666348 
10900.
Sentence 31: for instance hesperus agreed to help me find my property and i 
agreed  to take him to earth.
Sentence 32: 7.513561455654996 
10901.
Sentence 33: between individuals this process is called  bargaining.
  10.075132092453119 
10902.
Sentence 34: when it is done between races or nations it is called  making a 
treaty.
Sentence 35:  12.247404281143323 
10903.
Sentence 36: and the major part of my mission to your nest is to  make a 
treaty between your race and mine.
Sentence 37:  7.484009081100845 
10904.
Sentence 38: recovering the property was  much less important.
  9.670406878971576 
10905.
Sentence 39: and apparently impossible.
Sentence 40: 12.292407525564322 
10906.
Sentence 41: though it might be that we would have much to  give you you have 
nothing to give us.
Sentence 42:  11.094116013052464 
10907.
Sentence 43: hesperus and lucifer jack said show that we do.
Sentence 44:  6.764147616291221 
10908.
Sentence 45: another pause; but this one was not nearly as long.
  10.904068427512161 
10909.
Sentence 46: then it is a matter of  pleasure; of curiosity; of a more alive 
time.
Sentence 47: 14.373985640214492 
10910.
Sentence 48: yes those could be commodities under this concept.
  10.889027716785424 
10911.
Sentence 49: but you should understand jack  that hesperus and lucifer are not 
long out of the nursery.
Sentence 50:  8.283635008922003 
10912.
Sentence 51: visiting  the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of 
us who are older.
Sentence 52:  10.78831962583174 
10913.
Sentence 53: this explained a great deal.
Sentence 54:  11.309843967689007 
Sentence 1: 10914.
Sentence 2: all the more reason  then jack said why we must have a treaty.
  14.397144668987599 
10915.
Sentence 3: we will gladly entertain  your young and give them proper living 
quarters in return for their help in running our fusion reactors.
  6.558752098367788 
10916.
Sentence 4: but we must know if this  is in accordance with your customs and 
must have your agreement they  will not misuse the power we put in 
their hands to our hurt.
Sentence 5:  7.953229150945037 
10917.
Sentence 6: but this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the
  dictates of their own natures and respect yours in turn.
  7.717408201811601 
10918.
Sentence 7: to this we  of course agree.
Sentence 8: 16.190745095301136 
10919.
Sentence 9: jack felt a wave of complete elation but  in a second it had 
vanished without a trace.
Sentence 10:  5.8816751717433835 
10920.
Sentence 11: what gabriel was asking  was that mankind forego all its 
parochial moral judgments and contract to let the angels serve on earth 
as it is in heaven regardless  of the applicable earth laws.
  7.601954052211928 
10921.
Sentence 12: the angels in turn would exercise  similar restraints in 
respect for the natural preferences and natures  of the earthmen- but 
they had no faintest notion of man's perverse  habit of passing and 
enforcing laws which were contrary to his own  preferences and 
violations of his nature.
Sentence 13:  5.045119849433976 
10922.
Sentence 14: the simple treaty principle  that gabriel was asking him to 
ratify in short was nothing less than total trust.
Sentence 15: 8.901660027869564 
10923.
Sentence 16: and it might  be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels 
had of thinking  of everything in terms of absolutes that the proposal of 
anything less  might well amount instead to something like a 
declaration of war.
Sentence 17:  5.854493217679945 
10924.
Sentence 18: furthermore even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of
  jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could
  ever be codified.
Sentence 19:  6.921684858431951 
10925.
Sentence 20: almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward  suspicion 
not trust as the safest and sanest attitude toward all  outsiders.
  5.629028301924947 
10926.
Sentence 21: yet there was some precedent for it.
Sentence 22:  14.319941035478317 
10927.
Sentence 23: the history of disarmament agreements for instance had been 
unreassuringly dismal; but the united states and the union of soviet 
socialist republics  nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic 
bomb test ban and  a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's 
good intentions on  this limited question.
Sentence 24: 6.002904610295051 
10928.
Sentence 25: out of that agreement though not by any easy  road eventually 
emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations;  suspicion 
between member states still existed but it was of  about the same low 
order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry  between arizona 
and california over water supplies.
Sentence 26:  7.427094716615564 
10929.
Sentence 27: besides  agreements in principle with the petty details to be 
thrashed  out later were commonplace in diplomatic history.
  5.326519577128725 
10930.
Sentence 28: the trouble with  them was that they almost never worked and in 
fact an agreement in  principle historically turned out to be a sure 
sign that neither  party really wanted the quarrel settled.
  8.646848205708821 
10931.
Sentence 29: suppose that this one were to work?  9.127449882314659 
10932.
Sentence 30:  there was no question in jack's mind of the good faith on one side 
at least.
Sentence 31:  16.012429851565877 
10933.
Sentence 32: if mankind could be convinced of that h  it was worth trying.
  7.88257437762797 
10934.
Sentence 33: in fact it had to be tried.
Sentence 34:  24.98576663201377 
Sentence 1: 10935.
Sentence 2: it would  be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that 
earth had  ever signed.
Sentence 3:  7.950739728011832 
10936.
Sentence 4: secretary hart had taught jack at least partially to  be content 
with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters; but there  was no 
small way to handle this one.
Sentence 5:  7.002504151625705 
10937.
Sentence 6: he turned back to the screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his 
lips.
Sentence 7: 7.9256312140364 
10938.
Sentence 8: but he was too late.
Sentence 9: 27.657270061307578 
10939.
Sentence 10: he had lost his audience.
Sentence 11:  15.6306526737611 
10940.
Sentence 12: for a moment he could make no  sense at all of what he saw.
  13.883206222786983 
10941.
Sentence 13: it seemed to be only a riot of color light  and meaningless 
activity.

a loose estimate of how many men the hall  would hold at one time.

toilet i still could not tell for sure how far  to the rear the 
darkness extended.
Sentence 40:  6.1097525980689635 
12252.

comparison.

12253.
Sentence 43: i had for some time been hoping in vain for one of the dim

Sentence 3: it was i felt possible that they were men who having received no
  tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in

light.
Sentence 4:  6.460928090166492 
12256.
Sentence 5: this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my

or  squatting on the floor below.
Sentence 6:  6.842961066950583 
12257.

glances back over my shoulder.

would address me at  times quite sharply in order to bring back my 
attention.
Sentence 10: 8.339921044514817 
12259.
Sentence 11: and i had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the 
aforementioned occasion  when the lights in that place like the hall 
lights controlled from the switch in the office flicked off and on 
impatiently.

my papers was completed.
Sentence 20:  7.079044817757014

the hall at this point?  7.040574914466818

  6.243930524020066 
12270.
Sentence 29: i wished to  prepare myself but did not even know what sort of 
clothes i ought to  be wearing.
Sentence 30: 8.954214580296332 
12271.
Sentence 31: i did not despair however; far from it! i was constantly
  searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall.
  6.686641483035892 
12272.
Sentence 32: though  only a relatively short walk separated it from my own 
part of town  its character was wholly foreign to me.
Sentence 33: 6.44893033609597

piers prevented me from seeing it.

above the  pier roofs.
Sentence 38: 5.84660975948877 
12276.
Sentence 39: the sounds issuing from beyond- winches whirring men  shouting- 
indicated great activity and excited me.
Sentence 40:  8.086542342015262 
12277.
Sentence 41: the hall on the other hand appeared lifeless and deserted on these 
long waterfront  afternoons.
Sentence 42: 7.226639403582978 
12278.
Sentence 43: it resembled nothing i'd ever seen before.
Sentence 44:  14.718704829380005 
12279.
Sentence 45: its front was windowless but irregularities in the masonry might 
be an indication that windows now blinded had once looked out upon the 
street.
Sentence 46:  5.324825508063031 
12280.
Sentence 47: i  kept circling the block hoping to see from the street behind 
it the  rear of the hall.
Sentence 48:  7.123311798911028 
Sentence 1: 12281.
Sentence 2: but it was not a tall structure and other buildings  concealed 
it.

12282.
Sentence 4: for weeks i wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses  and 
garages truck terminals and taxi repair shops gasoline pumps  and

12287.
Sentence 12: when i asked him what if anything i could do about  it he

12304.
Sentence 42: but he came toward me sedately enough showed  me around the

12624.
Sentence 12: never he'd once told joyce had he encountered  any man or

  truly strong.
Sentence 30:  9.833131466668718

delicate appearance.
Sentence 32:  7.641549371017116 
12636.
Sentence 33: just nothing she told herself.
Sentence 34:  14.00840206751307

Sentence 45:   this ain't your brand maybe lord suggested.
Sentence 46:  7.14162538120728 
12644.

well in unexplored country.
Sentence 15: 6.257697475937866 
12658.
Sentence 16: and even with her limited  knowledge of such things she knew that 
the car could be repaired  there; sufficiently at least to get them back 
into town.

from her purse  and went through the motions of fixing her make-up.
  7.24409085326203 
12669.
Sentence 33: in his mood it was the best way to handle him; that is to show no 
curiosity whatsoever.
Sentence 34: 9.644754093518667 
12670.
Sentence 35: otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum- teased and provoked
  until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another 
battle  in the maddening struggle of tom lord vs joyce lakewood.
  6.22707212933008 
12671.
Sentence 36: the car lurched along at a snail's crawl the left-front mudguard

Sentence 40:  7.554841062732162

tension.
Sentence 42:  12.670897604273614 
12675.
Sentence 43: it poured out of him like an electric current a feeling that the 
muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action and that 
that  action would be all that he anticipated.
Sentence 44:  5.8388474235566274 
12676.
Sentence 45: joyce had seen him like  this once before- more than once 
actually but on one particularly  memorable occasion.
Sentence 46:  7.794217276071636 
12677.

office had made no previous issue of it.
Sentence 58:  8.897529244959287

Sentence 3:  13.671139498061125

12687.

12693.
Sentence 15:    well  i'll tell you about that lord told him.

Sentence 26: look lord he said hoarsely.
Sentence 27:  12.50213707625067 
12700.

12709.
Sentence 43: not without a face-saving respite of at least a few  minutes.
  9.512614553525596 
12710.
Sentence 44: to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible.

14402.
Sentence 9: ramey looked  down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of 
the man's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded blood-flecked 
substance lying by  itself on the pavement.
Sentence 10:  8.018348078589597

14448.

of  his pistol.

  on him as the life finally went out of the brute.

  away from the door where she slept better because keith was between

Sentence 18:  7.985971070036899 
14499.
Sentence 19: for a brief period each year the rays of  the sun are warm 
enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the 
headwalls and then the pinnacles glisten in the  daytime at high noon 
and billions of gallons of water begin their slow  seepage under the 
glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long 
meandering journey to the sea- running east past the  sky-carving 
massifs of gurla mandhata and kemchenjunga then turning south and curling 
down through the jungles of assam past the khasi  hills and into bengal 
past sirinjani and madaripur until the hard water of the melting snows 
mingles with the soft drainage of fields  and at length fans out to 
meld with the teeming salt depths of the  bay of bengal.
  4.5260378129053835 
14500.
Sentence 20: keith sterling had looked down on the brahmaputra more times than 
he could remember during the war days when  he flew over the hump of the

himself through outer space.
Sentence 21: 6.9201762169355145 
14501.
Sentence 22: but keith looked down more than up.
Sentence 23:  12.522280549824776 
14502.
Sentence 24: he thought of the jungles below him and  of the wild strange 
untracked beauty there and he promised himself  that someday he would 
return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner of the world where man 
is sometimes himself the hunted and animals  the lords.
Sentence 25: 6.593641122314151 
14503.
Sentence 26: at first it had been just a romantic dream of his the same as the

14505.
Sentence 30: wing commanders in the raf do not imply survival in the future

14507.

14509.
Sentence 38: he knew  how to shoot down nazis.
Sentence 39:  10.776005861178222 
14510.
Sentence 40: and he knew that the men talked about him  behind his back saying 
that he was one up on everybody else- including  the pilot of the plane 
Sentence 1: with the swastika on it- because he was chemically incapable of fear.
  8.209283960969968 
14511.
Sentence 2: that was true but only half the truth.
Sentence 3:  10.315313391184581 
14512.
Sentence 4: the other half he didn't like to recognize even to himself.
  11.757907923309139 
14513.
Sentence 5: not defending england or being an ace or fighting for humanity.
  7.545193944393053

Sentence 9: the nazis bombed britain  so the raf retaliated and shot them all 
down.
Sentence 10: 8.649006242526841 
14517.
Sentence 11: it  was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which 
the stupid insistence of the british on their right to their own country 
became  ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the nazis who were 
better  organized and technically superior.
Sentence 12:  5.3931104354385155 
14518.
Sentence 13: it took a long time before the  british tipped the balance.
  17.44642972928925 
14519.

risked.

  5.3090465830112485 
14526.

steel in a rapier.
Sentence 27:  10.416387373714832 
14527.
Sentence 28: he was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that
  give away the power in forearm and bicep.
Sentence 29:  8.158257085838253 
14528.
Sentence 30: his hair was black  already greying at the temples in the classic

  14.476850121589298 
14537.

15835.
Sentence 15: he was perhaps a trifle  tipsy having been long at sea where

17102.
Sentence 31: then from within the still sleeping  house the telephone had

happen.

17106.
Sentence 36: but they  weren't just friends lucy thought; they were husband and 
wife  and myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage.

17114.
Sentence 49: all that junk? 21.783273943592054 
Sentence 1: 17115.
Sentence 2:    susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes  that gushed an instant 
grief; to her each of her dolls was a real  person with a living heart.
  4.909776356406901 
17116.
Sentence 3: now now lucy said approaching  susan with a handkerchief mopping 
skillfully.

17123.
Sentence 15:    no susan  said grappling with her outsized armload of dolls 
with a scrooge-like  effect.
Sentence 16:  6.716105803734982 
17124.
Sentence 17: and at this point lucy thought there should be  a lecture on 
little cousins' sharing dolls- but she could sympathize with susan; there 
ought to be a limit to sharing too.
Sentence 18:  8.966895055504638 
17125.
Sentence 19: that was one more reason she didn't look forward to cathy's visit
  short or long; the last one had been a lilliputian war.

17126.
Sentence 20: she suspected  that cathy had been competing with susan for 
attention that she  had never had.

there.

would make her give in.
Sentence 23:  11.399306113189299 
18885.
Sentence 24: on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fumed 
while she stayed calm and adamant.
Sentence 25: 7.824183542320377 
18886.
Sentence 26: and if he surrendered after raving  at her.
  16.937531543662352 
18887.
Sentence 27: suppose he ran up the white flag altogether?  9.213166806925662

  7.953394054598466 
18896.

newly married had been left alone long enough.

  7.945119355047572

a little contest-   never again did he enter into the ritual of showing 
the apartment.

18919.
Sentence 19: they kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations.

18921.
Sentence 21: what to talk about?  19.946752732958277 
18922.
Sentence 22:    dolores kept picking up any of his clothes which he left  about 
but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions.
  7.649021478201203 
18923.
Sentence 23: he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and 
closets  so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers.
  6.307865687113482

18925.
Sentence 26: the sound of their amazement.
Sentence 27:  15.82973940139538

her now.
Sentence 35:  5.725106139771221 
18930.
Sentence 36: everyone would know why; he would  cut a supremely ridiculous 
figure.
Sentence 37:  8.588365263176025 
18931.
Sentence 38: day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he 
had made  for himself.
Sentence 39:  5.427950274147271 
18932.
Sentence 40: his mind scurried frantically seeking an exit.
  10.276228481933904 
18933.
Sentence 41: alternately  he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he 
determined sullenly  morosely to live out his life in this fashion.
  5.869723508637666 
18934.
Sentence 42: nothing would  change nothing would ever change.
Sentence 43: 11.20966096597004 
18935.
Sentence 44: when the solution finally  came to him one night while he was in

Sentence 1: 18936.
Sentence 2: in a frenzy of excitement he considered his plan.
  12.822520260437535 
18937.
Sentence 3: beside his shorts he would place something of hers.
  6.460370037324521 
18938.
Sentence 4: instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory 
for if she picked  up say a pair of her panties she might just as 
well lift his  shorts lying alongside- the expenditure of energy was 
almost the same.
Sentence 5: 5.944299494118182 
18939.
Sentence 6: he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to 
pick  up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor.
  8.666035271806566 
18940.
Sentence 7: furthermore  he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly: 
every time he went  in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere 
or maybe a girdle  next to his shorts.
Sentence 8:  5.867756097854561 
18941.
Sentence 9: sooner or later dolores would crack.
Sentence 10:  8.842581037245965 
18942.

be difficult  to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the 
apartment.
Sentence 12: 8.422244438181218 
18943.
Sentence 13: martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the
  next installment of her story.
Sentence 14:  6.3591809137220165 
18944.
Sentence 15: the tale he thought would become less gay.
Sentence 16:  11.387658710676023 
18945.
Sentence 17: she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his 
childishness  his lack of control his general male looseness while she
  remained cool airy and untouched the charming teacher who 
disciplined an unruly body.
Sentence 18:  5.1228410389078745 
18946.
Sentence 19: to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor  would draw 
her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd.
Sentence 20:  8.319279986639128 
18947.
Sentence 21: something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence
  of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he 
believed  in it since his courage and virility were involved because it
  was truly his.
Sentence 22:  5.83470013917517 
18948.
Sentence 23: the knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death  and 
took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted
  fanaticism.

18949.
Sentence 25: the next morning while dolores was out of  the room he went to 
her bureau drawer took out a pair of nylon lace  pants and tenderly 
dropped them next to his shorts.

18950.
Sentence 27: he sat down on the bed.
Sentence 28:  15.960151928300284 
18951.
Sentence 29: in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared.
  12.120094503603957 
18952.
Sentence 30: to  his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two garments.
  7.615092762846159 
18953.
Sentence 31: slowly and  deliberately she reached down and touched the lace 
with her fingers then hesitated for about a second.
  5.4458023473964055 
18954.
Sentence 32: ah he thought she's going through  the chain of reasoning which 
says she might really just as well  pick up my shorts too.
  6.290129093830134 
18955.
Sentence 33: he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the  implications of a 
plot which had been weeks in occurring to him.

Sentence 35: extending her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and 
swiftly  left the room.

and her eyes unsteady.
Sentence 38: 6.481903503096435 
18958.
Sentence 39: they breakfasted together  but martin did not refer to his triumph 
and dolores found a great  deal to do in the kitchen bobbing up and down 
from the table so that talk was impossible.
Sentence 40:  8.538074191159637 
18959.
Sentence 41: well martin thought that'll save.
Sentence 42:  10.59633742259972

these past weeks.

18967.
Sentence 12:    once it was william thought.
Sentence 13: 11.2066383623343 
18968.
Sentence 14: a rush of memory swept him back and he forgot cap.
  9.351014077090149 
18969.
Sentence 15: how did he start on such a ride to brief glory?  8.992337125359954 
18970.
Sentence 16:  simply enough through the inadvertent agency of his brother- in-
law.

18973.

18976.
Sentence 27: probably mr willis was influenced  toward deeper involvement by 
familial loyalty and a concern for  his grandchildren.

18977.
Sentence 28: gerry began to aid freddy with her father prodded no doubt by 
joan's open contempt for freddy and william's irritating competency.
  5.79563815281975

Sentence 1: 18985.

his work in new york had  given him a broader overall knowledge of 
business administration and corporate  structure; and if he wasn't

chance of wider opportunities.

18990.

  10.42897291276049 
19717.
Sentence 28: they had protested that that wasn't any  surprise.
  11.40431524167798 
19718.
Sentence 29: just you wait said arlene again as though  she were discovering 
the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy 
statement.
Sentence 30: 7.226542408095166 
19719.
Sentence 31: is it  anything like cooked-over oatmeal?
  11.757674309947575 
19720.
Sentence 32:  asked one of the children.
Sentence 33:  16.175384724461775 
19721.
Sentence 34: not the least bit arlene snapped.
Sentence 35:  10.009742122044596 
19722.
Sentence 36: one of the many things  that was so nice about her was that she 
always took your questions seriously  particularly your very very 
serious questions.
Sentence 37:  9.577967966312709 
19723.
Sentence 38: those were  especially the ones that all other grownups 
laughed at loudest.
Sentence 39:  7.303096616249475

seriously.
Sentence 41: 8.465871844437721 
19725.
Sentence 42: but not hard for very long.
Sentence 43:  13.32087353114638 
19726.
Sentence 44: just long enough to make you feel important.
  11.715879534826335 
19727.
Sentence 45: now said arlene eventually making them both sit in formation on a 
big root of a live oak the sort of root that divided  itself and made 
their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable.
Sentence 46: 5.090976854877514 
19728.
Sentence 47: now we're going to be like what general burnside and his horse 
make  us think of.
Sentence 48:  8.224938264294419 
19729.
Sentence 49: the children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down 
even more comfortably than ever.

Sentence 52: 10.783667833983843

Sentence 1: 19732.
Sentence 2: she held herself  that way and turned her head towards them and 
laughed and winked.
Sentence 3:  8.347995902467632

  of that picture frame at home one of them said.

19734.
Sentence 6: they both laughed  and winked back.
Sentence 7: 15.756408865151302 
19735.
Sentence 8: i'm general burnside's horse upside  down arlene said sort of 
gaspingly for her: even she had  to breathe kind of funny when she was 
in that position.
Sentence 9:  4.425653178766926 
19736.
Sentence 10: she made general  burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it 
was upside down.
Sentence 11: 9.676512795569494 
19737.
Sentence 12: then she was back on her feet winking and smiling that enormous
  smile .
Sentence 13:  7.635793100687079 
19738.
Sentence 14: and she would wink and throw  kisses.
Sentence 15:  15.52982985573769 
19739.

it made their lips and eyelids tremble.

19740.

  15.960440318808727 
19741.
Sentence 19: this time arlene said and she even kept on wiggling a little bit 
while she was just talking  you're going to tell me what i am and what 
i'm doing.
Sentence 20: 6.756255939431794 
19742.
Sentence 21: it  all has something to do with general burnside and his horse.
  9.391426916702418 
19743.
Sentence 22: this time it was so grand; they could tell exactly what it was.
  8.137615958976305 
19744.
Sentence 23: it was general burnside's horse running in a circle.
 15.046151236757142 
19745.
Sentence 24: his legs  shook and the shaking went right on up his body through 
his hips to his shoulders.
Sentence 25:  5.871550390903752 
19746.
Sentence 26: that's the general's horse one of them cried  out.
  5.415354612692042

horse.

19749.
Sentence 31: then there was the general kissing his  wife.
  21.420107508643188 
19750.
Sentence 32: they had to be told that one.
Sentence 33:  22.325776495404497 
19751.
Sentence 34: but it was even funnier after  they had been told.
  14.648717092110791 
19752.
Sentence 35: their father when he came back from those many  business trips 
just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips  and asked if 
anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric 
icebox.
Sentence 36:  6.7018463053934445 
19753.
Sentence 37: he was the funniest  man.
Sentence 38:  23.79268092013764 
19754.
Sentence 39: he never could keep still even when he didn't move his feet.
  10.162149928427366 
19755.
Sentence 40: then they had to get up and be general burnside.
  10.363349106105304 
19756.
Sentence 41: all they could think of was to run around in circles kicking their 
legs out.
Sentence 42:  8.078761807336596 
19757.
Sentence 43: then they said general  burnside was going to jump over his 
horse's head; and they did some  somersaults.
Sentence 44:  7.411452263715024 
19758.
Sentence 45: but that wasn't very funny either.
Sentence 46:  18.3893642127394 
19759.
Sentence 47: you ought to shake arlene advised them.
Sentence 48:  7.622507342753323 
19760.
Sentence 49: and arlene showed them how to begin.
Sentence 50:  12.994442504837197 
19761.
Sentence 51: she also taught them to sing i wish i could shimmy like  my 
sister kate.
Sentence 52:  6.892894936471871 
19762.
Sentence 53: they were clumsy but they  were beginning to catch on.
  11.555775202424963 
19763.
Sentence 54: they also caught on a little bit on how to  smile a lot without 
your lips trembling.
Sentence 55:  7.5839703308888335 
Sentence 1: 19764.
Sentence 2: imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling- 
or smiling with your  lips trembling too much arlene suggested.
  6.865122331529688 
19765.
Sentence 3: that helped a  great deal.
Sentence 4: 13.51881576711259 
19766.
Sentence 5: they were a little late in getting home.
Sentence 6:  14.103111039843219 
19767.
Sentence 7: i'm sorry mrs minks arlene said in a tone so low you could
  hardly hear it.
Sentence 8:  6.119512922998314 
19768.
Sentence 9: my mother constituted herself the voice  of all of us.
  9.544951717477968 
19769.
Sentence 10: it's perfectly understandable arlene my mother  said in a 
friendly way.
Sentence 11:  2.9647453471384653 
19770.
Sentence 12: i suppose you all were playing and forgot?  13.024390396949448 
19771.
Sentence 13:   yes ma'am the children chorused heartily.
Sentence 14:  7.622507342753323 
19772.
Sentence 15: the children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters; and arlene 
began tapping the kitchen door  open.
Sentence 16: 8.605312244972199 
19773.
Sentence 17: arlene's a good girl my uncle remarked to us; but he said it too 
soon for it came out just before the tap to which the  door responded.
  5.023258872600587 
19774.
Sentence 18: that tap had a slight bangish quality.
Sentence 19:  12.064727433049098 
19775.
Sentence 20: she really is a dear little thing my mother agreed.
  6.460370037324521 
19776.
Sentence 21: her upper lip  lifted  slightly.
Sentence 22:  16.19638981266906 
19777.
Sentence 23: she was biting into a small red radish; and that action
  always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing.
  6.031690067332049 
19778.
Sentence 24: also she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up 
in  a neat mean little heap at the white center of the radish.
  7.02958142141867 
19779.
Sentence 25: she would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat 
under her teeth  to the place where she was biting.
Sentence 26:  5.710096329777779 
19780.
Sentence 27: it never worked naturally; but  it made her look unusual.
  13.153065790889992 
19781.
Sentence 28: also when she had bitten off half of the small  radish she found 
the suspense unbearable; and she would snatch  the finger-held half 
of the radish out to where she could inspect it.
Sentence 29:  5.365154197334842 
19782.
Sentence 30: one could hear a very faint ladylike sigh of relief.
  11.192387044095703 
19783.
Sentence 31: actually it  was inaudible to anyone not expecting it.
  7.832100794927304 
19784.
Sentence 32: but the warm joy of her brown  eyes was open to the general 
public.
Sentence 33:  12.847023587006271 
19785.
Sentence 34: later on the children told her further about somersaulting.
  9.72542028910215 
19786.
Sentence 35: it must be awfully good  for them.
Sentence 36:  22.218495701750093 
19787.
Sentence 37: and awfully kind of arlene she told us later.
Sentence 38:  8.108856755126041 
19788.
Sentence 39: but do you know something curious?  10.472119682746735 
19789.
Sentence 40:  she added.
Sentence 41:  19.287214484918096 
19790.
Sentence 42: i reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my 
dress.
Sentence 43:  9.485141232370898 
19791.
Sentence 44: i have no notion  why i reached.
Sentence 45:  16.546284712656718 
19792.
Sentence 46: and i found a radish.
Sentence 47: 20.850026924177687 
19793.
Sentence 48: was it an omen? 15.900962242516597 
19794.
Sentence 49:  i thought  for a second.
Sentence 50:  18.25917094604721 
19795.
Sentence 51: but i would not pamper myself in that silly way.
  12.175845375235337 
19796.
Sentence 52: i opened the window and threw the radish out.
  10.853733375513935 
19797.
Sentence 53: then my mother blushed at this small lie; for she knew and we 
knew that it was cowardice that had made one more radish that night just 
too impossible  a strain.
Sentence 54:  5.169171608445684 
Sentence 1: 19798.

19803.
Sentence 10: as a matter of fact this happened every four or five months.
  13.44148944679596 
19804.
Sentence 11: sometimes he coincided  with my father's being at home.
  9.734355488595261 
19805.
Sentence 12: sometimes as at this juncture he did not.
Sentence 13:  8.52362262641104 
19806.
Sentence 14: but he was always persuaded out.
Sentence 15: 23.176187158177306 
19807.
Sentence 16: he liked children  in a loathsome kind of way; the two youngest 
in our family always had  to be brought in and put through tricks for 
his entertainment.
Sentence 17:  5.8610968321433035 
19808.
Sentence 18: when he  had left i could never remember whether he had poked 
them in their  middles laughingly with a thick index finger or whether 
he was merely  so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed 
the action not bothering to look.
Sentence 19: 6.458464347883421

taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one 
of them and then putting down her radish  with a shiver.
  6.828123948775004 
19812.
Sentence 25: they were pushed gently into the room by arlene- whose only part

a  horselike balkiness of demeanor.

19817.

else's long boring story.
Sentence 55:  6.383417673952361 
19830.
Sentence 56: but this  time she was nervous: she was open.
