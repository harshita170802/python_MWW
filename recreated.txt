Sentence 1: SENTENCES AND THEIR PERPLEXITY
Sentence 5: it exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much
Sentence 7: 8.728591527828165
Sentence 9: the treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex largely
Sentence 12: 6.615961936568926
Sentence 14: there are more stems per item in athabascan which expresses the fact
Sentence 18: 6.185036032343352
Sentence 20: this may be because the athabascan divergence began earlier;  or
Sentence 23: 8.631973106403073
Sentence 25: the differentiation however is not very much greater as shown by the
Sentence 27: 6.538213540886913
Sentence 29: 46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.
Sentence 30: 9.060328853487057
Sentence 32: 75 for yokuts with a slightly greater number of languages represented
Sentence 33: 24 as against 21.
Sentence 34: 5.502176915627405
Sentence 36: 46 the stemitem rate becomes 3.
Sentence 37: 9.670406878971576
Sentence 39: 75 in equivalent number  these general facts are mentioned to make
Sentence 42: 5.179837570019059
Sentence 44: the greatest difference in the two sets of figures  is due to
Sentence 46: 10.332046148128628
Sentence 48: these differences in turn result from the fact that my yokuts
Sentence 55: 5.028892733101507
Sentence 57: swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was
Sentence 61: the  result is that i included 70 animal names but swadesh only 4;
Sentence 63: 5.087179511422533
Sentence 65: swadesh and therefore  hoijer felt compelled to omit all terms
Sentence 70: the groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as
Sentence 72: 6.817408452020724
Sentence 74: other classes are included only by myself  or only by swadesh and
Sentence 76: 7.978194376184139
Sentence 78: what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes
Sentence 81: 6.12313065054314
Sentence 83: 7; nature  ratios 3.
Sentence 84: 13.148092146312546

Sentence 92: 4.
Sentence 93: 15.610129252044759
Sentence 95: it will be seen that where the scope is similar the athabascan ratios
Sentence 98: 9.045337757272964
Sentence 100: this exception may be connected with hoijer's  use of a much higher
Sentence 101: 22% of his total  list as against 3.
Sentence 103: 24.
Sentence 104: or the exception may be due to a particular  durability peculiar to
Sentence 106: 8.61877755139381
Sentence 108: more word class ratios  determined in more languages will no doubt
Sentence 110: 7.5205271291023905
Sentence 112: if word classes differ in their resistance or liability  to stem
Sentence 117: hoijer's athabascan and my yokuts share 71 identical meanings
Sentence 120: 5.427950274147271
Sentence 122: for yokuts i tabulated these 71 items in five columns according as
Sentence 124: 7.595570160058267
Sentence 126: the totals for these  five categories are not too uneven namely 20
Sentence 128: 6.524770666309441
Sentence 130: for athabascan with a greater range of stems the first two  of
Sentence 134: 6.550606834276504
Sentence 136: while the particular limits of these groupings  may  seem artificially
Sentence 141: 4.682836779562854
Sentence 143: when now  we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two
Sentence 145: f   this
Sentence 147: f; which divided by f gives a mean of 1.
Sentence 148: 6.434128523283288
Sentence 150: if  the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the
Sentence 152: 6.513384599908015
Sentence 154: if it were wholly random and unrelated it would be 2.
Sentence 157: 0 assuming the five classes were equal in  n which approximately
Sentence 159: 5.825820622377272
Sentence 161: the actual mean of 1.
Sentence 162: 14.473707740438117
Sentence 164: 07 being  about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.
Sentence 167: 0 of no correlation  it is evident that there is a pretty fair
Sentence 170: 7.955102452449978
Sentence 172: in 1960 david d  thomas published basic vocabulary in some mon-
Sentence 177: 5.149571480829994
Sentence 179: thomas' findings are first that the individual items vary greatly and
Sentence 184: 5.624255452947053
Sentence 186: his second  conclusion on semantic word classes agrees with mine.
Sentence 189: this second conclusion  independently arrived at by independent stud y
Sentence 192: 6.799513485470034
Sentence 194: thomas also presents a  simple equation for deriving an index of
Sentence 197: 5.4177742112174165
Sentence 198: 44.
Sentence 199: thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is
Sentence 204: his formula will have to be weighed may be  altered or improved
Sentence 208: but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning
Sentence 214: as to relative frequencies of competing roots  thomas with his
Sentence 217: 8.547756579228864
Sentence 219: the problem needs further  exploration.
Sentence 220: 22.165869735070007
Sentence 222: i was at least conscious of the distinction in my full  yokuts
Sentence 228: 4.8797042156450265
Sentence 230: these  findings and others which will in time be developed will
Sentence 232: 6.886249538313906
Sentence 234: if adjectival meanings show  relatively low retentiveness of stems
Sentence 240: had hoijer  substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal
Sentence 243: 7.298545742196723
Sentence 245: and irrespective of the outcome  in centuries elapsed since
Sentence 249: 5.767439297566063
Sentence 251: it is evident that swadesh  has not only had much experience with
Sentence 256: why then this urge to include unstable items  in his basic list?
Sentence 259: it is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical  and
Sentence 261: 12.442278316468771
Sentence 263: and why that insistence? 14.555411229397368
Sentence 265: it is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal
Sentence 267: 9.465001668613668
Sentence 269: but it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope  is a
Sentence 271: 12.424296328749232
Sentence 273: not that such a list cannot be constructed; but the nearer  it
Sentence 276: 7.844105784047764
Sentence 278: its terms will tend to be labile or vague and they  will fit actual
Sentence 280: 6.42576203557217
Sentence 282: the practical operational  problem of lexicostatistics is the
Sentence 286: 7.290353792070676
Sentence 288: the most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as
Sentence 290: 9.832938595357035
Sentence 291: 64.
Sentence 292: in proportion as meanings are concrete we can better rely on their
Sentence 294: 8.437918402470649
Sentence 296: an elephant or a fox or a swan  or a cocopalm or a banana possess
Sentence 299: 4.78159956739805
Sentence 301: they isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously from the
Sentence 306: with the universal list as his weapon swadesh  has  extended his
Sentence 309: 6.230423970274787
Sentence 311: and he has proclaimed greater or less  affiliation between all
Sentence 313: 11.58297419486788
Sentence 315: some of this may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether
Sentence 319: but the farther out he  moves the thinner will be his hold on
Sentence 322: 7.749359232300311
Sentence 324: he has traversed provinces  and kingdoms but he has not
Sentence 328: he has announced results on hokan penutian  uto-aztecan and almost
Sentence 333: 6.98735958858241
Sentence 335: the  remote cloudy possible has values of its own- values of scope
Sentence 337: 5.542917982132687
Sentence 339: but there is also a firm aspect  to lexicostatistics
Sentence 346: 6.996827000608089
Sentence 348: this involves step-by-step progress and such  will have to be the
Sentence 351: 6.66389881289832
Sentence 353: if of the founders of glottochronology  swadesh has escaped our
Sentence 356: 8.503651134789727
Sentence 358: there is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by swadesh's
Sentence 361: 7.69902962183697
Sentence 363: it seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for
Sentence 367: i would propose first an abandonment of attempts at a  universal
Sentence 370: 7.014494436854544
Sentence 372: i would propose  next as the prime requirement for constitution of
Sentence 375: 7.607930874954649
Sentence 377: there would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme
Sentence 380: 82.
Sentence 381: an attempted middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word
Sentence 385: doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise
Sentence 387: 5.708822330446606
Sentence 389: it was nevertheless  almost incredible that four years after yalta
Sentence 394: 7.473001118686811
Sentence 396: when the yalta conference  opened the american policy of
Sentence 399: 6.126432428280739
Sentence 401: starting  in great force late in december from a line stretching
Sentence 408: the long  delay in opening the second front was now working to
Sentence 410: 6.916450125045957
Sentence 412: the west was now glad to propose the 1919 curzon line  which was
Sentence 415: 7.762277199031083
Sentence 417: when this proposal was made stalin spoke with stronger emotion than
Sentence 419: 8.106352765305958
Sentence 421: he stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject.
Sentence 424: the bitter  memory of russia's exclusion from the paris peace
Sentence 427: 5.377873882341562
Sentence 429: you would drive us into shame he declared.
Sentence 430: 13.406219579674467
Sentence 432: the white russians and the ukrainians would say that stalin and
Sentence 435: 6.075272924218582
Sentence 437: yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accepted  the curzon
Sentence 442: he did not mind the line itself which churchill  declared in the
Sentence 447: the west had long since forgotten the events  of 1919 but it was not
Sentence 450: 8.618551205849084
Sentence 452: in the dunn-atherton  memorandum of february 4 1942 the state
Sentence 455: 6.832600518618727
Sentence 457: now stalin made it clear that he meant to move poland's western

Sentence 467: 4.827482875085593
Sentence 468: 100.
Sentence 469: stalin declared that he preferred to continue the war a little
Sentence 472: 6.819269873304742
Sentence 474: by this time churchill was not so cordial toward  moving poland
Sentence 477: 6.969062989540919
Sentence 479: after a prolonged study of the oder line on a map at teheran
Sentence 481: 8.74814951941821
Sentence 483: he would tell the poles he said that they had been given a fine
Sentence 485: 9.564420203776912
Sentence 487: at yalta he thought more about the six million germans who would
Sentence 491: 6.906432085468935
Sentence 493: the  issue was left in abeyance presumably for the peace
Sentence 495: 6.210871206873012
Sentence 497: however  there was no real question of the justice of creating a
Sentence 500: 7.364264802002414
Sentence 502: the moving of millions of the  german master-race from the very
Sentence 508: of more importance to  the west than poland's boundaries was the
Sentence 510: 9.827207519900966
Sentence 512: at yalta the west still believed that eastern europe could  be
Sentence 516: though little democracy had ever been practised in this region and
Sentence 522: believing devoutly  as they did in anglo-saxon institutions it
Sentence 525: 5.582660386211355
Sentence 527: the  issue was acute because the exiled polish government in london
Sentence 530: 6.285623209801457
Sentence 532: more time was spent in trying to marry these imcompatibles than over
Sentence 534: 6.613882986952077
Sentence 536: the result was an agreement that the lublin government should  be
Sentence 541: 7.171389008449886
Sentence 543: all  democratic and anti-nazi parties were to have the right to
Sentence 545: 8.60017061892347
Sentence 547: roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this  issue.
Sentence 550: it was a matter of principle with churchill since britain had
Sentence 552: 10.710732658326823
Sentence 554: to stalin it was a matter of life and death.
Sentence 555: 12.691818152519138
Sentence 557: he made this completely clear.
Sentence 558: 15.6592618679761
Sentence 560: speaking with great  earnestness he said
Sentence 563: 7.851115675798787
Sentence 565: throughout history poland has been the corridor through which the
Sentence 567: 7.19285726202354
Sentence 568: 122.
Sentence 569: twice in the last thirty years our enemies the germans have passed
Sentence 571: 8.642096335028143
Sentence 573: it is in  russia's interest that poland should be strong and
Sentence 576: 6.663715531423359
Sentence 578: it  is necessary that poland should be free independent in power.
Sentence 581: therefore  it is not only a question of honor but of life and death
Sentence 583: 7.570220816879001
Sentence 585: in other words the soviet union was determined  to create a
Sentence 592: byrnes says that invariably thereafter the soviets used  the same
Sentence 594: 5.236383152695367
Sentence 596: this reasoning  was also as inevitable as anything could be.
Sentence 599: any free elections  that were to be held in poland would have to
Sentence 605: in even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of
Sentence 609: 8.489818451404345
Sentence 611: but at yalta the conflicting expectations of east and west were
Sentence 615: 6.531336251593324
Sentence 617: in any case where in their judgment conditions require italics added
Sentence 622: 7.450455915064485
Sentence 624: other similar affirmations in the declaration on liberated europe
Sentence 628: later it developed that the soviets had a very different

Sentence 635: professor mcneill thinks that  at yalta stalin did not fully
Sentence 642: 4.7797399001735625
Sentence 644: also war-time propaganda and cooperation had obscured  the
Sentence 648: 6.468543815099058

Sentence 653: 138.
Sentence 654: while obliged  to concede governments in east europe allied with
Sentence 657: 6.6370135465677
Sentence 659: this illusion was described  in a far-sighted editorial in the new
Sentence 662: 6.4527692069919995
Sentence 664: in doing so marshall and byrnes were asking  for the ratification
Sentence 668: we had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory
Sentence 672: we  were troubled about the fate of the baltic states.
Sentence 675: yalta left us with  comforting illusions of a western capitalist-
Sentence 678: 5.2837367373482085
Sentence 680: this is a penetrating description of our post-war illusion which
Sentence 682: 11.495982403811642
Sentence 684: the same editorial continued that we expected to democrati ze  japan
Sentence 687: 6.715385273756662
Sentence 689: we expected in short that most of the world  would make itself over
Sentence 694: yet actually the image corresponded in no  way to the actualities
Sentence 696: 6.243154353761418
Sentence 698: neither our military our  economic nor our ideological power
Sentence 702: then the editorial added prophetically
Sentence 705: 5.965493587431165
Sentence 707: here is  the best short explanation of the origins of the cold
Sentence 709: 11.13548449334414
Sentence 711: failing to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite
Sentence 718: then china promptly went communist and mr truman  had to fight the
Sentence 721: 6.751343930133445
Sentence 723: years of war strain and hatred; of heavy arms expenditures  and
Sentence 728: 5.2738299689048365
Sentence 730: yet in summarizing a series of careful essays on the yalta
Sentence 734: 6.809470125442189
Sentence 736: when the yalta papers  were finally published with great fanfare
Sentence 738: 7.170514433846036
Sentence 740: an analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts.
Sentence 743: first is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation
Sentence 745: 6.128169709851021
Sentence 746: 158.
Sentence 747: preparation began slightly more than a year after  independence with
Sentence 749: 10.417059200410714
Sentence 751: all  political interests supported electoral planning although
Sentence 754: 5.0176589645046334
Sentence 756: the second major aspect of the election is the  actual procedure
Sentence 758: 10.818179727270726
Sentence 760: considerable  technical skill was used and the administration of
Sentence 762: 5.84660975948877
Sentence 764: however the regionally differentiated results which appear below in
Sentence 767: 7.920384203407302
Sentence 769: a third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy  is
Sentence 771: 7.434516341352785
Sentence 773: the electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party
Sentence 779: the fourth and concluding point will  be to estimate the long-run
Sentence 782: 6.493803891370578
Sentence 784: elections  have figured prominently in nearly every government
Sentence 786: 7.391013650626644
Sentence 788: they were stressed in the speeches of si mubarak bekkai when the
Sentence 791: 6.460546636110325
Sentence 793: king muhammad 5 was known to be most sympathetic to the formation
Sentence 796: 6.44427897715385
Sentence 798: there followed a long and sometimes bitter  discussion of the
Sentence 802: 6.971495133471284
Sentence 804: since the complicated process of establishing new communes and
Sentence 809: from  the very beginning the electoral discussions raised

Sentence 891: by this time there is little doubt but what election plans were
Sentence 893: 10.547210313821306
Sentence 895: there remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws
Sentence 898: 7.929122625251148
Sentence 900: from the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in morocco an
Sentence 903: 5.6528382033448725
Sentence 905: in  the new country the electoral process is considered as a means
Sentence 908: 7.733390038209328

Sentence 923: those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the
Sentence 925: 6.421517266114742

Sentence 1491: such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave
Sentence 1493: 9.205662875528139
Sentence 1495: a further possibility is suggested by the example of the g i bills
Sentence 1497: that is to provide  financial assistance to individuals for
Sentence 1500: 316.
Sentence 1501: this probably would require some support  for subsistence as
Sentence 1506: a maximum of $600 per year per student would  enable many to take

Sentence 1514: instead of being limited to the poor  training facilities in
Sentence 1517: 6.191809541506003

Sentence 1537: but briefly the topping configuration must be examined for its
Sentence 1539: 10.422895192819478
Sentence 1541: then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had

Sentence 1550: the very idea  of their being count rules implies that there is
Sentence 1555: this expectation is what really sold point and figure.
Sentence 1558: but there is no positive  and consistently demonstrable

Sentence 1571: the advantages and disadvantages  of these two types of charting
Sentence 1577: they are both trend-following  methods.

Sentence 1580: even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum the
Sentence 1583: 7.296276724163929
Sentence 1585: of course many  more things are charted besides prices.
Sentence 1588: the foregoing have been methods  of charting prices but now let us

Sentence 1593: the search for forecasting  formulae is ceaseless.
Sentence 1596: correlations have been worked up between  the loading of freight
Sentence 1598: 7.573088559200683
Sentence 1599: 339.
Sentence 1600: the theory  behind this is of course fundamentalist in character.
Sentence 1603: as the number  of reported freight car loadings increased this
Sentence 1607: 7.5604248182385145
Sentence 1609: we now know that things rarely ever work out in such  cut-and-
Sentence 1613: 5.268257814628907
Sentence 1615: but the quest for such an index  goes on ceaselessly with all
Sentence 1619: which way
Sentence 1622: it recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of
Sentence 1626: just  as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern
Sentence 1628: 6.765292791664436
Sentence 1630: much of this goes on in offices high up in wall street's lofty wind-
Sentence 1632: 8.799700606863594
Sentence 1634: there sit men who make moving averages of  weekly volume monthly
Sentence 1639: 6.5329568239833335
Sentence 1641: they are concerned with all things traded in securities bonds cocao
Sentence 1643: 7.130610841418014
Sentence 1645: and along  chicago's  west jackson boulevard la salle street and
Sentence 1651: they plot the open  interest curves rainfall curves and they even
Sentence 1655: all these things and countless  more enter into their
Sentence 1659: not at any rate in the fuller sense of the word.
Sentence 1660: 10.41961614256415
Sentence 1662: the markets are far too subtle and the last word in these
Sentence 1665: 6.7869342764888
Sentence 1667: but whereas civilized  men no longer pursue the fountain they never
Sentence 1669: 6.478669021782826
Sentence 1671: we mentioned odd-lot indices a  few paragraphs ago.
Sentence 1674: in the stock market the normal trading package  is a hundred
Sentence 1678: a stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed via a
Sentence 1682: this  results in a separate record being made distinguishing these
Sentence 1684: 5.427950274147271
Sentence 1686: according to the theory underlying odd-lot indices the trader who
Sentence 1689: 7.525890903229159
Sentence 1690: 359.
Sentence 1691: or to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast
Sentence 1694: 5.747675891275695
Sentence 1696: falling  most easily prey to an adverse market movement for this
Sentence 1701: figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales
Sentence 1705: odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to
Sentence 1707: 7.315499381373
Sentence 1709: they might for example plot it exactly  as is or they might make ten
Sentence 1714: the particular recipe is a matter of individual  taste.
Sentence 1717: the data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price  chart
Sentence 1719: 6.5934285901583936
Sentence 1721: towards the end of  an intermediate or major rise while the top
Sentence 1724: 5.996607848305864
Sentence 1726: this warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite
Sentence 1728: 6.881506374313357
Sentence 1730: similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle  towards the end
Sentence 1735: 6.539445720418356
Sentence 1737: thus in the aggregate  the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the
Sentence 1740: 6.675713120289759
Sentence 1742: while it had long been known in general that the public is always
Sentence 1745: 6.884772243478044
Sentence 1747: one might well wonder why the public is always wrong  and the
Sentence 1750: 6.666574571708565
Sentence 1752: which came first? 16.656679898684356
Sentence 1754: is it really that  the public buys at the tops and not that the
Sentence 1757: and the converse at bottoms.
Sentence 1758: 18.014471815902706
Sentence 1760: does the public  usually sell at bottoms or does the market usually
Sentence 1763: we have been using the word  public in quotation marks that is
Sentence 1766: 10.599296140579101
Sentence 1768: obviously someone has  to sell in order for someone to buy and vice
Sentence 1770: 6.456554449617568
Sentence 1772: and while all concerned are members of the literal public somewhat
Sentence 1775: 8.221542909854108
Sentence 1777: and the public minus the public leaves the so-called sophisticated
Sentence 1780: 8.880868923355205
Sentence 1782: this element is often called strong  hands.
Sentence 1783: 12.83916464908928
Sentence 1785: strong hands differ from weak hands in that their operations  are
Sentence 1787: 5.739601853441883
Sentence 1788: 382.
Sentence 1789: they initiate campaigns so to speak  even if this initiation is
Sentence 1792: 7.832937789961806
Sentence 1794: strong hands act; weak hands react.
Sentence 1795: 8.43480713758077
Sentence 1797: strong hands move first; weak hands ask what is going on?
Sentence 1800: when strong hands buy they are able to buy more and they do it even
Sentence 1802: 6.309614669264672
Sentence 1804: they are able to sit more patiently  with what they have bought.
Sentence 1807: needless to say strong hands are  not eager to be joined by weak
Sentence 1811: 5.445008461773956
Sentence 1813: certain  badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel
Sentence 1816: 6.54618033837685
Sentence 1818: but after all can anyone imagine  a market wherein the reverse of

Sentence 1839: membership  in the echelons fluctuates too.
Sentence 1840: 10.472119682746735
Sentence 1842: the study of odd-lot indices is somehow akin to the spectacle of a

Sentence 2203: there is some clear-cut evidence  of this.
Sentence 2204: 29.657441313011308
Sentence 2206: for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans  for
Sentence 2209: 7.899503569053473
Sentence 2211: indeed the failure of home-building as a  whole to respond this
Sentence 2216: 5.978533333968285
Sentence 2218: in a way we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of
Sentence 2222: 6.329886548599659
Sentence 2224: the huge backlog of demand  which was evident in the first decade
Sentence 2228: 7.301164534361352
Sentence 2230: the consuming public has used up a good part of these  liquid

Sentence 2245: markets should become more competitive  as consumers become more

Sentence 2252: 6.7066642067806415
Sentence 2254: wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of
Sentence 2257: 8.355571022862344
Sentence 2259: the purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which
Sentence 2263: 5.109450006460001
Sentence 2265: while there may be several such industries  to which the model of
Sentence 2271: indeed the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude  in
Sentence 2274: 6.298799455806308
Sentence 2276: the model of this paper considers an industry which is not
Sentence 2280: 6.403496419865711
Sentence 2282: where the industry's product price has been kept below the profit-
Sentence 2286: 5.387003401415467
Sentence 2288: the contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this
Sentence 2292: in order  to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force
Sentence 2297: 5.396800420302613
Sentence 2299: for  expository purposes this is best treated as a model which
Sentence 2303: 5.898567685259947
Sentence 2305: part 1 below describes this abstract model by spelling out its
Sentence 2307: 9.402241878138415
Sentence 2309: part 2 discusses the operation of the model and derives some
Sentence 2311: 17.646198622485493
Sentence 2313: part 3 discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of
Sentence 2315: 9.402241878138415
Sentence 2317: part 4 is a brief summary.
Sentence 2318: 18.958301390356997
Sentence 2320: the  mathematical appendix presents the rigorous argument but is
Sentence 2323: 5.2588932223382265
Sentence 2325: the industry with which this model is concerned is a  basic
Sentence 2329: for the purposes of setting the product price the industry behaves
Sentence 2331: 7.419583361482161
Sentence 2333: the demand  we are concerned with aggregate  demand for the
Sentence 2335: 10.132857641369208
Sentence 2336: 491.
Sentence 2337: the manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given.
Sentence 2340: in any given time period the aggregate  demand for the industry's
Sentence 2341: the price charged by the industry
Sentence 2343: 8.284700927658132
Sentence 2345: for  the purposes of this discussion the problem of relative prices
Sentence 2349: the form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity
Sentence 2352: 7.914375602143917
Sentence 2354: the industry of  this model is so important that its wage and price
Sentence 2356: 6.445889539651649
Sentence 2358: because of its importance and because the  lack of price
Sentence 2362: 7.9186265889259735
Sentence 2364: the threat of effective anti-trust action  provoked by gouging
Sentence 2369: 5.211515995650729
Sentence 2371: for the  industry of this model the effect of such public
Sentence 2376: for  such an industry it is only safe to raise its price if such an
Sentence 2380: thus if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that
Sentence 2383: 7.278809401750381
Sentence 2385: in this model we abstract from all non-wage  sources of cost
Sentence 2388: 6.675706588318595
Sentence 2390: in such circumstances it may well be  to the advantage of the
Sentence 2394: since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises the  profit-
Sentence 2397: 5.436345134758126
Sentence 2399: the entry-limiting  price will also be raised for potential
Sentence 2405: the foreign-entry-limit price would  be approached more rapidly
Sentence 2409: where this approach becomes critical the industry  can be expected
Sentence 2413: 6.856003628414112
Sentence 2415: whether or not it is in the industry's interest  to allow the
Sentence 2420: 6.519434087516143
Sentence 2422: the extent to which the public-limit price  is raised by a given
Sentence 2423: 
Sentence 2424: the passage of time the level of gnp  and the size of the wage
Sentence 2426: 9.57946891104516
Sentence 2428: we are abstracting from the fact of strikes here but it should be
Sentence 2432: 6.171101474222841
Sentence 2434: the industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure
Sentence 2437: 7.363291223855055
Sentence 2439: as a strike continues these parties increase  their pressure on the
Sentence 2441: 8.59397126627422
Sentence 2443: they become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that
Sentence 2445: 8.586863099314062
Sentence 2447: public indignation and resistance to wage-price increases is
Sentence 2452: the simple passage of an additional  eleven months' time makes
Sentence 2454: 8.510875472925726
Sentence 2456: thus  the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage
Sentence 2460: notice however  that the passage of time does not permit the
Sentence 2464: similarly higher levels of gnp do not in themselves provide grounds
Sentence 2469: this is not extended to anticipated levels of gnp however- only the
Sentence 2472: 8.291928358643258
Sentence 2474: finally since the public requires some restraint on the part  of
Sentence 2478: 4.794951715532896
Sentence 2480: we  assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of
Sentence 2483: 7.175602276588529
Sentence 2485: the level of this average cost is determined by factor prices
Sentence 2487: 7.413864179236019
Sentence 2489: as we have noted however we are abstracting  from changes in all
Sentence 2493: the level of average cost is e.
Sentence 2494: 11.903366396315082
Sentence 2496: union policies and collective  the single union which faces the
Sentence 2500: 6.962842864600112
Sentence 2502: the union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a
Sentence 2506: 5.555803646439296
Sentence 2508: the union vigorously demands wage increases from  productivity
Sentence 2511: 7.210955619203047
Sentence 2513: for our present  purposes we assume that the sole subject of
Sentence 2516: 6.343945375272807
Sentence 2517: 528.
Sentence 2518: productivity is something of an amorphous concept and  the amount
Sentence 2523: disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the
Sentence 2526: 5.796116151346321
Sentence 2528: the existence of conflict and of  vigorous union demand for an
Sentence 2533: 7.328733749567969
Sentence 2535: we assume further that the union  recognizes the possibility that
Sentence 2539: 5.465702329130352
Sentence 2541: for internal political reasons the union asks for  increases in the
Sentence 2545: 6.776597605551481
Sentence 2547: changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising and they constitute
Sentence 2549: 6.174387796979883
Sentence 2551: however it is not known to either the union or the public precisely
Sentence 2555: 8.131445400735494
Sentence 2557: in this model then the industry is presumed to realize that  they
Sentence 2562: 5.529126206527752
Sentence 2564: thus for non-negative changes  in the basic wage rate the
Sentence 2569: the presumption in the literature would appear  to be that the
Sentence 2574: from this presumption it is an easy  step to the conclusion that
Sentence 2579: it is this conclusion that we challenge; we do  so by disproving
Sentence 2581: 9.319725633419784
Sentence 2583: of the model  it is convenient to assume that the union-industry
Sentence 2585: 10.944772266895875
Sentence 2587: in the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became
Sentence 2589: 9.931625484358362
Sentence 2591: several factors contributed to this change.
Sentence 2592: 11.107336869440822
Sentence 2594: the  congress of vienna is a convenient starting point because it
Sentence 2596: 5.236383152695367
Sentence 2598: here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for
Sentence 2600: 10.59089513322992
Sentence 2602: thus the congress marks a formal recognition of the political system
Sentence 2604: 7.076798287833172
Sentence 2606: international  law had to fit the conditions of europe and
Sentence 2610: 7.649294764530398
Sentence 2611: 547.
Sentence 2612: essentially this imposed two conditions
Sentence 2619: in both respects international law was europeanized.
Sentence 2622: it was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would
Sentence 2624: 9.265494440764135
Sentence 2626: on the one hand the major european nations had to maintain vis-a-vis
Sentence 2632: 7.368190119787844
Sentence 2634: but there was no pressing need to maintain  these same standards
Sentence 2636: 14.057053281171957
Sentence 2638: thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the
Sentence 2641: 6.5712493751857
Sentence 2643: political interference in africa  and asia and even in latin
Sentence 2648: 6.141119012741397
Sentence 2650: a nation such as switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and
Sentence 2656: this europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of
Sentence 2658: 7.336738903232112
Sentence 2660: more emphasis was put upon the fact that international  law was the
Sentence 2664: 8.09091364691852
Sentence 2666: wheaton stated that the public law was essentially limited to the
Sentence 2669: 5.5870627374518325
Sentence 2671: of course it had always been of european origin in fact  but it had
Sentence 2675: now with virtually every writer not only was the european origin
Sentence 2679: 5.516751111784525
Sentence 2681: the european customs on which international law was based were to
Sentence 2686: hall for example was quite explicit on this point when he said
Sentence 2689: 5.031061973382939
Sentence 2691: they must do something with the  acquiescence of the latter or
Sentence 2694: 8.547440744412572
Sentence 2696: during the nineteenth century these views were protested by
Sentence 2698: as the new nations of africa and asia protest them with more effect
Sentence 2700: 6.633074813899798
Sentence 2702: a number of other nineteenth-century developments  contributed  to
Sentence 2706: 8.96969692551629
Sentence 2708: the difference  is important for although the older law of nations
Sentence 2711: 5.800747303873487
Sentence 2713: the law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their
Sentence 2716: 10.579873523647176
Sentence 2718: the theory of international law which in the nineteenth  century
Sentence 2721: 6.413080507903362
Sentence 2723: it lost sight of the  individual almost entirely and confined
Sentence 2727: 6.869095168730342
Sentence 2729: no longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine
Sentence 2732: 5.806997634055077
Sentence 2734: to appreciate this development we must relate it to other aspects
Sentence 2736: 8.985884733762152
Sentence 2738: first and most obvious was the growing nationalism and the tendency
Sentence 2741: 5.662242888225814
Sentence 2743: national identification was not new but it was accelerating in
Sentence 2747: it reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of state
Sentence 2751: 5.437096434310103
Sentence 2753: national  identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law
Sentence 2758: in the international community  this reduced law to jellinek's
Sentence 2760: 10.466002073342645
Sentence 2762: a state the highest form of human organization in fact and theory
Sentence 2765: 7.110216203716876
Sentence 2767: according  to the new theories the nineteenth century corporate
Sentence 2770: 6.598466918976268
Sentence 2772: he no longer sought to find the law; he made it;  he could be
Sentence 2774: 8.50328803992675
Sentence 2776: there was  no law domestic or international except that willed by
Sentence 2778: 7.114600149770193
Sentence 2780: hidden behind hegelian abstractions  were more practical reasons
Sentence 2782: 7.615092762846159
Sentence 2784: related  to but distinguishable from nationalism was the growth
Sentence 2786: 6.2553469477383485
Sentence 2788: increased participation in politics and the demands of various
Sentence 2791: 6.54093796655646
Sentence 2793: the efforts of various interest groups  to control or influence
Sentence 2796: the legislative power and the means whereby  policy could be formulated
Sentence 2798: 5.736287051074467
Sentence 2800: law became a conscious process something more than simply  doing
Sentence 2803: 6.559337496133126
Sentence 2805: particularly was this true when the norms previously  applied
Sentence 2808: 5.491981963951048
Sentence 2810: the  old way of doing things which depended on a relatively stable
Sentence 2813: 6.09983039226678
Sentence 2815: first was the period of codification of existing  law
Sentence 2820: codification was followed in all countries  by a growing amount of

Sentence 2840: in municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as
Sentence 2844: 7.306761231795977
Sentence 2846: when the power of the latter was made  both limited and explicit-
Sentence 2849: government was made subservient to an institutionalized
Sentence 2854: it is true that initially the task was to remove restrictions that
Sentence 2857: 9.614481769026716
Sentence 2859: law was seen as an emanation of the sovereign will.
Sentence 2860: 6.661604752959209
Sentence 2862: however the sovereign was not hobbes' absolute monarch but rather
Sentence 2864: 8.890041874635154
Sentence 2866: it was too an optimistic  philosophy and though it separated law
Sentence 2870: man through democratic institutions  of government and economic

Sentence 2874: the theory  did not require though it unfortunately might acquire a

Sentence 2878: it was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions
Sentence 2880: 12.325109250313941
Sentence 2882: it was not opposed to either justice  or morality; it merely
Sentence 2885: 7.6621748616035825
Sentence 2887: particularly was this true as  laissez-faire capitalism became

Sentence 2891: to free the factors of production was a major objective of the

Sentence 2905: indeed contract was the dominant legal theme of the century the

Sentence 2909: government itself was based upon contract; business organization- the
Sentence 2914: 6.363875850014182
Sentence 2916: it is not surprising that the international  obligations of states

Sentence 2920: in  fact some- anzilotti is the principle example- went so far as
Sentence 2923: 6.9957381580628155
Sentence 2925: the displacement of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth
Sentence 2928: 5.780140237098333
Sentence 2930: in the first place the new doctrine brought  a  formal separation
Sentence 2933: 8.808409683008206
Sentence 2935: one result  was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the
Sentence 2937: 9.620783781909985
Sentence 2939: admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problems which arise
Sentence 2943: 5.981212406117234
Sentence 2945: private international law  was thus segregated from international
Sentence 2949: states were free to enact within broad though determinate
Sentence 2953: 6.285259729134857
Sentence 2955: the change was not quite  so dramatic as it sounds because in
Sentence 2959: 4.983969984190278
Sentence 2961: mr justice black was one of the minority that rested on the article
Sentence 2963: 11.318938631307228
Sentence 2965: in this view supported by only three members of the court a power

Sentence 2970: if this seems arbitrary its effect was to treat citizens of the
Sentence 2973: 8.649624649458028
Sentence 2975: for almost  a hundred years we relied upon state courts  for the
Sentence 2977: 6.062694230526357
Sentence 2979: then in 1875 apparently in response to the nationalizing influence
Sentence 2981: authority- concurrently with state tribunals- to decide cases involving
Sentence 2983: 8.091251517131603
Sentence 2985: one purpose of the change  was to attain sympathetic enforcement
Sentence 2988: 6.4441271001144615
Sentence 2990: serious difficulty arose  with the advent of substantive due
Sentence 2992: 8.843367331156275
Sentence 2994: an amendment presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly
Sentence 2997: 6.9640844673372415
Sentence 2999: a flood  of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the
Sentence 3001: 8.40106343233402
Sentence 3003: congress reacted with a series of measures modifying  in various
Sentence 3005: 6.2016166993573245
Sentence 3007: in 1910 it required the convening of a special three-judge court for
Sentence 3010: 8.160106390452345
Sentence 3012: such  legislation was clarified and extended from time to time
Sentence 3014: 7.795383746932392
Sentence 3016: in 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal
Sentence 3020: the essential  ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934
Sentence 3023: 5.670580783382225
Sentence 3025: three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions
Sentence 3027: 8.371670676500804
Sentence 3029: this saved for state adjudication in the first instance the two
Sentence 3032: 5.736786668550141
Sentence 3034: meanwhile the supreme court like congress showed misgivings
Sentence 3038: drawing upon  the traditional discretion of the chancellor mr
Sentence 3042: 5.076847533455262
Sentence 3044: whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the
Sentence 3047: 6.458755637005268
Sentence 3049: the classic case is railroad commission v pullman.
Sentence 3050: 9.377114209797627
Sentence 3052: the commission had issued an administrative order  which was
Sentence 3054: 9.45273821686523
Sentence 3056: its enforcement  was enjoined by a federal trial court.
Sentence 3059: on review the supreme  court via mr justice frankfurter found
Sentence 3063: 6.757773177684674
Sentence 3065: an alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether
Sentence 3067: 6.135225267642463
Sentence 3069: reluctant as usual  to interpret state legislation- such
Sentence 3074: but it is crucial that here unlike burford the trial court was
Sentence 3077: 6.834754824926213
Sentence 3078: 642.
Sentence 3079: the resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid
Sentence 3082: 6.830397971433521
Sentence 3084: temporary abstention ie postponement is one thing; refusal to
Sentence 3086: 6.002446559592496
Sentence 3088: to the extent that the jurisdictional  principle of 1875 stands
Sentence 3092: 7.40347327650156
Sentence 3094: in alabama public service  commission v southern ry co the
Sentence 3097: 6.012361463777105
Sentence 3099: the railroad claiming deprivation of property without due process
Sentence 3101: 8.346523409839932
Sentence 3103: the court held that federal  jurisdiction should not be exercised
Sentence 3106: 9.128661418672582
Sentence 3108: justices frankfurter and jackson concurred in the court's result
Sentence 3110: 6.643215071337043
Sentence 3112: but they objected vigorously to the proposition that federal courts
Sentence 3113: 
Sentence 3118: by  these measures congress so the court in effect now decides
Sentence 3124: a most revealing recent case is textile workers union v lincoln
Sentence 3126: 7.190017756155806
Sentence 3128: the taft-hartley act gave the federal courts jurisdiction  over
Sentence 3133: on its face this merely provides a federal forum; it does  not
Sentence 3135: 5.84258359218675
Sentence 3137: how  can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights
Sentence 3140: the court held that congress had intended  the federal judiciary
Sentence 3144: in short congressional power to grant federal-question  authority
Sentence 3147: 7.729890560022165
Sentence 3149: the lincoln mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal
Sentence 3151: conflict in federal and
Sentence 3156: 4.986091856538282
Sentence 3158: the justice's elaborate examination of the legislative history  of
Sentence 3161: 6.955804554600195
Sentence 3163: with a few exceptions the lawmakers  seemed unaware of the
Sentence 3166: 6.38148884954061
Sentence 3167: 660.
Sentence 3168: to avoid these constitutional difficulties mr justice frankfurter
Sentence 3171: 7.526093915719312
Sentence 3173: this  would satisfy what presumably was congress' major purpose- the
Sentence 3175: 6.002446559592496
Sentence 3177: it would also leave intact the states' traditional authority in the
Sentence 3179: 13.670035913708034
Sentence 3181: and york decisions require federal courts in diversity cases  here
Sentence 3184: 5.998727237315507
Sentence 3186: if congress wants to displace the states from areas which they have
Sentence 3190: and let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal
Sentence 3192: 7.195806614831201
Sentence 3194: does lincoln mills suggest that if congress granted jurisdiction
Sentence 3199: there is a common problem behind most of these federal question
Sentence 3201: 6.308942906593172
Sentence 3203: congress has not clearly defined the bounds  between state and
Sentence 3205: 8.55795084636185
Sentence 3207: it has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter
Sentence 3209: 9.768059765417965
Sentence 3211: a careful student has suggested that in any  new revision of the
Sentence 3217: 6.1626295077968525
Sentence 3219: obviously the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in mr
Sentence 3222: 5.439876757492909
Sentence 3224: the same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in
Sentence 3227: 7.471042682756322
Sentence 3229: mr justice black no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to
Sentence 3233: he will not be fooled  by technicalities.
Sentence 3234: 22.184678737871383
Sentence 3236: with few  exceptions congress has not given federal courts
Sentence 3240: to put it differently  state and federal courts have concurrent
Sentence 3244: to insure uniformity in the meaning  of national law however
Sentence 3248: it may be noted parenthetically that to evade desegregation  an
Sentence 3251: 9.768417744115498
Sentence 3253: the result of course  would be that federal law inevitably would
Sentence 3255: 8.53640913803731
Sentence 3257: it would also probably mean different things within the same state-
Sentence 3259: 11.022160136999576
Sentence 3261: we consider here only a few of many problems involved  in this
Sentence 3263: 8.937712413973937
Sentence 3264: 682.
Sentence 3265: the first is that enforcement  of national law in state
Sentence 3268: 7.427227232736106
Sentence 3270: subject to  certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair
Sentence 3273: 5.688768559615062
Sentence 3275: litigants  who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go
Sentence 3277: 6.703888492474915
Sentence 3279: a similar canon applies to those  who press state claims in federal
Sentence 3281: 6.20469847978654
Sentence 3283: in an fela  controversy the state court followed established state
Sentence 3286: 8.144935308854754
Sentence 3288: in other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon  the
Sentence 3290: 10.806022916250093
Sentence 3292: the result was that the plaintiff's case  was dismissed.
Sentence 3295: mr justice black led a reversing majority
Sentence 3298: 5.50077428060064
Sentence 3300: here as  in the byrd case another element of state procedure was
Sentence 3302: 8.168656102496268
Sentence 3304: justices frankfurter and jackson dissented
Sentence 3307: 4.903693293796623
Sentence 3309: if  a litigant chooses to enforce a federal right in a state court
Sentence 3316: federal law though invoked  in a state court delimits the federal
Sentence 3319: 5.321182526784233
Sentence 3321: but the form in  which the claim must be stated need not be
Sentence 3328: another problem in the area of federal-state  relationships is this
Sentence 3332: terminiello v chicago involved a conviction  for disorderly conduct
Sentence 3334: 7.391013650626644
Sentence 3336: the conduct in question was a speech.
Sentence 3337: 9.802060557618772
Sentence 3339: the accused did not object to the trial court's  charge to the
Sentence 3343: 6.678516632233705
Sentence 3345: for present purposes it may be assumed  that this charge so narrowly
Sentence 3349: though the accused raised many other objections he did not object on
Sentence 3351: 7.621359693134935
Sentence 3353: that is he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his
Sentence 3356: 7.581696088016995
Sentence 3358: how else can one explain for example allowing the survival of the
Sentence 3360: amortize bond issue expenses; or allowing a deduction  for payment of
Sentence 3370: these items and most of the others listed above seem  quite
Sentence 3373: 6.634885315513075
Sentence 3375: there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction
Sentence 3378: 14.753173423342616
Sentence 3380: with respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381
Sentence 3384: 5.559283008340014
Sentence 3386: to this extent some stretching  of the literal meaning of the
Sentence 3391: it is not contended that section  381 should prescribe the survival
Sentence 3393: 11.727342546857113
Sentence 3395: such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction
Sentence 3400: 8.522585692541186
Sentence 3402: section  203 of the united states code voids an assignment of a
Sentence 3406: 5.642704308197593
Sentence 3408: if it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions this
Sentence 3412: 7.498761370764141
Sentence 3414: a clearly recognized  exception is a statutory merger or
Sentence 3416: 7.563545188002981
Sentence 3418: the leading case seaboard air line railway v united states held
Sentence 3421: 7.138324771884965
Sentence 3423: the court said the purpose  of the section was principally to spare
Sentence 3429: neither reason said the court applied  to the case at hand;
Sentence 3432: 7.262193183316376
Sentence 3434: other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors
Sentence 3438: exceptions  are often classified as transfers by operation of law.
Sentence 3441: a tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or
Sentence 3444: 6.428042594137934
Sentence 3445: 718.
Sentence 3446: although it is in some ways comparable to  a voluntary sale of
Sentence 3451: 7.1967541645501045
Sentence 3453: a recent case in point is mitchell canneries v united states in
Sentence 3457: 0.0

Sentence 3466: in an earlier case  kingan + co v united states an american
Sentence 3470: 5.968420493411964
Sentence 3472: the anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the  american
Sentence 3475: 7.500466656432886
Sentence 3477: the transaction presumably would have qualified under  section 368
Sentence 3482: the court nevertheless relied  on the seaboard case and also
Sentence 3486: in substance said the court  there was no transfer of equitable
Sentence 3488: 7.8924097041785695
Sentence 3490: the treasury arrives  at substantially the same conclusion but
Sentence 3494: revenue ruling 54-17 provides  that if the corporation against

Sentence 3503: 8.574928159153368
Sentence 3505: if the succession is a matter of public record certificates  of
Sentence 3511: the former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger  or
Sentence 3513: 8.185228423961119
Sentence 3515: the ruling  would not however apply to an acquisition of assets for
Sentence 3517: 6.817408452020724
Sentence 3519: a recent  ruling although rather confusing cites and follows rev
Sentence 3521: 9.12172255696927
Sentence 3523: the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory  or
Sentence 3525: 6.88426636131984
Sentence 3527: hence a successor corporation  in a c reorganization appears
Sentence 3530: 6.8750612108477425
Sentence 3532: in a b reorganization followed by a section 332 liquidation those
Sentence 3534: liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund
Sentence 3536: 5.534405781745756
Sentence 3538: in fact a cash purchase of a corporation's  stock followed by
Sentence 3542: 7.081106674528976
Sentence 3544: as stated in seaboard and numerous other cases the two  primary
Sentence 3549: 6.198766535614133
Sentence 3551: the cases have allowed transfer of claims  if beneficial
Sentence 3553: 8.988549970243525
Sentence 3555: the first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer
Sentence 3558: 6.84324716232423
Sentence 3560: section  381 applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a
Sentence 3565: 6.7160766240447245
Sentence 3567: in virtually every case the transferor corporation is liquidated and
Sentence 3570: 5.623288987766043
Sentence 3572: in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting
Sentence 3574: 11.398853737876168
Sentence 3576: furthermore in a c reorganization the continuing interest of
Sentence 3580: 4.922682199475459
Sentence 3582: nor is it  at all likely that a desperate claim against the
Sentence 3585: 7.022035670826433
Sentence 3587: if the transferor has substantial assets other than the  claim it
Sentence 3591: 6.175078871902545
Sentence 3593: if such an unlikely transaction were to take place it would more

Sentence 3609: 7.584985073860341
Sentence 3611: section 203 of the united  states code has been interpreted as not
Sentence 3614: 5.26078977701207
Sentence 3616: the successor  corporations have been held entitled to sue on
Sentence 3618: 9.439803099895592
Sentence 3620: tax attributes of the transferor  there are certain tax attributes

Sentence 3631: the parent of a group filing consolidated  returns might be
Sentence 3638: similar considerations presumably made  it difficult to prescribe a
Sentence 3641: 6.551339090505491
Sentence 3643: other sections  of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for
Sentence 3646: 5.280011632582226
Sentence 3648: section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis
Sentence 3652: 6.943969103411335
Sentence 3654: section 169 permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities
Sentence 3658: however  a similar privilege was not specifically provided in
Sentence 3665: for example suppose another excess profits  tax similar to prior
Sentence 3669: this carryover right has a number of things in  common with a net
Sentence 3671: 9.765064975238827
Sentence 3673: it is an averaging device  intended to ease the tax burden of
Sentence 3677: 6.961470608139972
Sentence 3679: under the 1939 code this item  was permitted to survive a tax-
Sentence 3684: 6.032286788469066
Sentence 3686: since this type of item was not in the statute when section 381 was
Sentence 3689: 6.080643184489887
Sentence 3691: with respect to this  type of item one might properly apply the
Sentence 3695: 7.234953563956535
Sentence 3697: actually there do not presently appear to be items in the statute
Sentence 3699: 6.965778513435225
Sentence 3701: probably the primary reason  for special treatment of a net
Sentence 3704: 7.5340394207877655
Sentence 3706: there were two  methods that could have been used for conducting
Sentence 3707: interviews in depth with a
Sentence 3710: 8.253737241627519
Sentence 3712: while the method of interviewing a small number of companies was
Sentence 3714: fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and
Sentence 3719: as a result it was decided that  a mail questionnaire sent to a

Sentence 3726: it was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would
Sentence 3729: 9.703149147297152
Sentence 3731: it is recognized that a mail questionnaire  has inherent
Sentence 3733: 15.059863694715913
Sentence 3735: there is the danger that the questions will  mean different things
Sentence 3737: 15.195843488785012
Sentence 3739: simple yes or no answers do not reveal the different shades of
Sentence 3741: 5.236383152695367
Sentence 3743: a respondent may want to make alternative  answers because he

Sentence 4929: before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us
Sentence 4932: 5.608378724760888
Sentence 4934: that reference  in the report is continuation of the trend toward

Sentence 4975: 0.0
Sentence 4977: solve from the summary report before us at this conference a number
Sentence 4979: 7.032105024464237
Sentence 4981: they vex us and perplex us but generally  do not divide us like
Sentence 4983: 6.165728248550333
Sentence 4985: first how can we step up the desegregation movement?
Sentence 4988: it is slow.
Sentence 4989: 36.00803266626256
Sentence 4991: i believe we all want more schools where white and negro together
Sentence 4993: 10.160786003411646
Sentence 4995: i believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on
Sentence 4997: 7.834138346144816
Sentence 4999: in general members of nairo would certainly want a child admitted
Sentence 5003: how to achieve this objective is a problem but we are not divided
Sentence 5005: 8.146047738832012
Sentence 5007: second as  we increase the number of desegregated school districts
Sentence 5011: it may be county school board or state school board action as
Sentence 5013: 5.491101831995351
Sentence 5015: correlatively can we reduce the  role of the district courts so
Sentence 5019: this is a problem and i believe there is little difference of
Sentence 5022: 6.20438690488103
Sentence 5023: 1048.
Sentence 5024: third how can we insure a systematic  and continuing group
Sentence 5027: not simply a brief program when the schools are actually
Sentence 5031: 5.146252086216957
Sentence 5033: again the problem is how to get it done and  in what form to offer
Sentence 5037: fourth in the segregated school system during  the period before
Sentence 5040: in fact in the desegregated school system which may have a
Sentence 5044: this is a problem but we are not divided over its importance
Sentence 5046: 7.689518665736176
Sentence 5048: fifth in the segregated school system  or in the all-negro or all-
Sentence 5053: can we help children adjust to images of other  children when the
Sentence 5055: 6.548128333577244
Sentence 5057: if we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively
Sentence 5063: on the basis of pupil assignment criteria  judge albert bryan has
Sentence 5066: 7.566995301365297
Sentence 5068: shall we support pupil assignment? 12.08571470746697
Sentence 5070: on the other hand looking at the larger picture  is it true that
Sentence 5074: shall we therefore  oppose the plan? 10.887392182380525
Sentence 5076: this question is an issue because it likely divides  issue no 2.
Sentence 5079: in large cities like baltimore louisville and washington dc should
Sentence 5083: on the one hand do we argue the supreme court decision required
Sentence 5087: or should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to
Sentence 5092: 6.174419021617177
Sentence 5094: we can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation
Sentence 5097: 6.9024427847783665
Sentence 5099: the earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that
Sentence 5101: 8.974001790468822
Sentence 5103: in each instance the plaintiff was a private citizen.
Sentence 5106: in thousands of school districts indeed in the entire  state of
Sentence 5108: 8.621803017189182
Sentence 5110: and i have established that the action of municipal county or state
Sentence 5113: 6.901257031030996
Sentence 5114: 1070.
Sentence 5115: is the requirement that the plaintiff be  a person actually
Sentence 5118: should congress authorize the attorney general to file suit to
Sentence 5122: even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the
Sentence 5126: this is an issue for it divides issue no 4.
Sentence 5127: 12.213840627304437
Sentence 5129: withholding of funds to  schools  that deny children on
Sentence 5131: 8.392032887190927
Sentence 5133: which in 1957 divided even a liberal group like the american
Sentence 5135: 6.92414119425721
Sentence 5137: should we support a clause in federal  school construction or
Sentence 5142: this is softer than earlier powell amendments  which would have
Sentence 5144: 7.523821884502484
Sentence 5146: there is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause
Sentence 5149: 10.605516123639461
Sentence 5151: the federal funds limitation enlists the support  issue no 5.
Sentence 5154: state or county or municipality be required to furnish public
Sentence 5157: for the  school year 1959-1960 the prince edward county board
Sentence 5161: 5.102165593191952
Sentence 5163: is public education in this american democracy  of such
Sentence 5167: or is this subject a matter of self-determination a matter of
Sentence 5170: if people don't want to provide public  education should they
Sentence 5173: even if we marshal substantial  agreement behind mandatory public
Sentence 5176: 7.323296889232142
Sentence 5178: should the requirement which must therefore be federal in nature be
Sentence 5181: or must it become law by amendment  of the united states
Sentence 5184: we actually have two issues  issue no 6.
Sentence 5185: 12.350455461918722
Sentence 5187: federal  responsibility  if the above issue is settled  by
Sentence 5191: if on the other hand it is not settled or while it is being
Sentence 5196: nearly  half the children still receive no education.
Sentence 5199: must or should the federal  government help? 11.370484883642249
Sentence 5201: should the government directly provide education for the children
Sentence 5204: the next question is whether board members favor their own
Sentence 5207: 1095.
Sentence 5208: on the whole  it appears that they do not favor their own social
Sentence 5210: 8.425242012536481
Sentence 5212: seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly
Sentence 5214: 7.391013650626644
Sentence 5216: a hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment
Sentence 5222: in situations  of this sort the board generally favors the
Sentence 5224: 10.719333657765663
Sentence 5226: campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve
Sentence 5231: 4.724966825105998
Sentence 5233: the few cases  of clear favoritism along social-class lines are
Sentence 5238: 6.367977412875587
Sentence 5240: in general it appears that trustees and board members  attempt to
Sentence 5245: 6.361855879047815
Sentence 5247: there have been very few cases  of explicit conflict of interest
Sentence 5250: 12.699315043633343
Sentence 5252: if there were more such  cases it would be easier to answer the
Sentence 5256: there is currently a major  controversy of public education in
Sentence 5260: this is the issue of segregated schools in the  south.
Sentence 5263: in this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial
Sentence 5265: 12.308892810911882
Sentence 5267: thus the white middle and  lower classes are arrayed against the
Sentence 5269: 7.263647365339972
Sentence 5271: this conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white
Sentence 5275: if this happens there may be some class conflict in the south with
Sentence 5279: profession the members of the educational profession have  a
Sentence 5282: 6.89969586624074
Sentence 5284: they are mostly upper-middle-  and lower-middle-class people
Sentence 5286: 8.787595714730568
Sentence 5288: do they  make class-biased decisions? 18.261201714858576
Sentence 5290: in a society dominated by middle-class  values and working in
Sentence 5294: 7.154243147573318
Sentence 5296: there is no problem here.
Sentence 5297: 38.54824360862788
Sentence 5299: the problem arises if it does arise when  the educator has to
Sentence 5301: competence but which bears some relation to the social  structure.
Sentence 5304: for instance in giving school grades or in making recommendations
Sentence 5309: again  in deciding on the content and method of his teaching
Sentence 5314: the answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some
Sentence 5318: 7.451224991241274
Sentence 5320: in a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class
Sentence 5324: 5.693122519752309
Sentence 5326: one upward-mobile teacher may  be a hard taskmaster for lower-
Sentence 5332: 6.277950691907261
Sentence 5334: one social-class factor which plays a large part in educational
Sentence 5338: 8.12586095518219
Sentence 5340: their own experience in the social system influences their work and
Sentence 5342: 8.421470663586687
Sentence 5344: while this influence is a complex matter depending upon personality
Sentence 5349: 5.929995765816837
Sentence 5351: teachers who have been upward mobile  probably see education as
Sentence 5355: 6.387270587124048
Sentence 5357: this does  not necessarily  mean that such teachers will favor
Sentence 5362: 5.121493868389423
Sentence 5364: there is no doubt  that higher education since world war 2 has
Sentence 5367: 10.854145123463256
Sentence 5369: there are several causes for this one being rapid economic
Sentence 5372: 7.59824863207075
Sentence 5374: but another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar
Sentence 5377: 9.483146522310149
Sentence 5379: compared  with the college and university faculty members of the
Sentence 5383: 5.550364805113821
Sentence 5385: their experience is quite in contrast  with that of children of
Sentence 5387: to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the
Sentence 5389: 5.975020594050363
Sentence 5391: public interest groups educational policies are formed by
Sentence 5394: 5.436915451534505
Sentence 5396: legislators are one such group and state legislators  have major
Sentence 5398: 7.573678157029758
Sentence 5400: they generally  vote so as to serve their own constituency and if
Sentence 5404: 5.384436755662661
Sentence 5406: however there are relatively few such political constituencies
Sentence 5410: 8.188238995637574
Sentence 5412: another public interest group is the commission  of laymen or
Sentence 5415: 5.1810199162904835
Sentence 5417: generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the
Sentence 5419: 9.294980793470286
Sentence 5421: nevertheless their conclusions and recommendations cannot
Sentence 5424: 5.540612788665263
Sentence 5426: for instance there have been two presidential  commissions on
Sentence 5428: 9.954621313235615
Sentence 5430: president  truman's commission on higher education tended to take a
Sentence 5435: both commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people
Sentence 5437: 9.482598161344603
Sentence 5439: an example of a more definite class bias is noted in proceedings
Sentence 5443: 5.880463582323862
Sentence 5445: this commission recommended against  the use of federal
Sentence 5448: 7.63730999433199
Sentence 5450: this might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias
Sentence 5455: which recommended a federal government scholarship program.
Sentence 5458: furthermore  the commission set up the council for financial
Sentence 5461: 5.302159047362073
Sentence 5463: thus the commission acted with a sense of social responsibility
Sentence 5466: 8.440386484331679
Sentence 5468: then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational
Sentence 5472: 5.104444336480956
Sentence 5474: these people are practically always upper-  or upper-middle-class
Sentence 5477: 9.103410757568346
Sentence 5479: finally there are  the parent organizations and the laymen's
Sentence 5482: 5.213142008167744
Sentence 5483: 1150.
Sentence 5484: these have an upper-middle-class leadership  and a middle-class
Sentence 5487: 7.102710703707135
Sentence 5489: like the  other policy-making groups these are middle class in
Sentence 5492: 6.439371841790622
Sentence 5494: in general it appears that educational decisions  and educational
Sentence 5497: 8.1074534664535
Sentence 5499: they are predominantly middle-  and upper-class people and
Sentence 5503: they may be unaware of the existence of lower-class  values and
Sentence 5505: 11.14482350074271
Sentence 5507: but there  is very little frank and conscious espousal of the
Sentence 5510: 8.060959254816881
Sentence 5512: they think of themselves as trustees for the entire society  and
Sentence 5514: 10.117231603742042
Sentence 5516: structure through education educational policy in the united states
Sentence 5519: 6.768046299083138
Sentence 5521: in so far as this goal is achieved the society becomes more  fluid
Sentence 5525: 7.165973639630922
Sentence 5527: on the other hand there is a counterbalancing  purpose in
Sentence 5530: 9.727633695331967
Sentence 5532: this leads to efforts at exclusiveness through private schools and
Sentence 5536: both of these purposes exist side by side without much  overt
Sentence 5538: 7.9972330755528285
Sentence 5540: cultural opportunity  the broad expansion of free education results
Sentence 5545: fifty years  ago the general raising of the school-leaving age
Sentence 5547: 6.002215013717486
Sentence 5549: during the past decade the program has been  carried on through
Sentence 5552: 10.054652246647121
Sentence 5554: the reaffirmation of  american faith in the comprehensive high
Sentence 5558: 5.932533542136036
Sentence 5560: the recent federal government's student-loan program is another
Sentence 5563: 8.649388165460405
Sentence 5565: it is probably more effective than the expanded  scholarship
Sentence 5571: meanwhile the private colleges have increased their tuition rates
Sentence 5574: 7.676127303733819
Sentence 5575: 1169.
Sentence 5576: the gains  in educational opportunity during the past decade have
Sentence 5580: unfortunately however and for reasons to be discussed in the
Sentence 5586: and this fact may explain  some of the disagreements among the
Sentence 5589: 6.2781638530718995
Sentence 5591: one such disagreement which will receive attention in  this next
Sentence 5596: 6.502755049470885
Sentence 5598: here the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma.
Sentence 5601: of fully distributed cost analysis  despite  an ambiguity due
Sentence 5605: 6.546426555807296
Sentence 5607: for more explicit expositions one must distinguish different types
Sentence 5609: 7.737557619512619
Sentence 5611: by all means the most important distinction is that  between
Sentence 5617: 6.095530112225769
Sentence 5619: the first or double-step type might also be called the railroad
Sentence 5622: 6.432115827158744
Sentence 5624: the cost section distinguishes between variable costs and constant
Sentence 5626: 10.24704502735875
Sentence 5628: the variable costs alone are assigned to the different units  of
Sentence 5632: 5.0046560062954315
Sentence 5634: there remains a residue  of total costs or total revenue
Sentence 5638: 8.032408593233063
Sentence 5640: nevertheless because the cost section has felt impelled to make
Sentence 5645: 4.866873249240942
Sentence 5647: in recent  years this burden  has amounted to about one third
Sentence 5650: 0.0
Sentence 5652: since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates
Sentence 5656: 5.73960382994971
Sentence 5658: suffice it to say that the usefulness  of the latter apportionment
Sentence 5660: 9.702587602609029
Sentence 5662: but in any event full credit should be given to the cost section
Sentence 5664: namely that between a cost
Sentence 5665: allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response
Sentence 5670: 4.943969441475346
Sentence 5672: we turn  now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which
Sentence 5674: the single-step type.
Sentence 5675: 6.800110163833493
Sentence 5677: it might be called the public  utility type because of the
Sentence 5680: 7.829481784314367
Sentence 5682: here no attempt is  made first to determine out- of-pocket or
Sentence 5685: 7.598128215981978
Sentence 5687: instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs
Sentence 5690: 6.246346625347419
Sentence 5692: moreover whereas in interstate commerce  commission parlance
Sentence 5698: 5.956240182645304
Sentence 5700: as already noted in an earlier  paragraph the more familiar cost
Sentence 5704: 5.149423346456481
Sentence 5706: this grand division permits many costs to be assigned in their
Sentence 5711: high-tension industrial power service for example would not  be
Sentence 5714: 5.255287088186279
Sentence 5716: but the major portions of the total  costs of a utility business
Sentence 5722: 6.172384540920799
Sentence 5724: the general basis on  which these common costs are assigned to
Sentence 5728: 5.498561634147128
Sentence 5730: but before turning to this  example we must distinguish two
Sentence 5733: 7.802811247176351
Sentence 5735: in the first subtype the analyst distributes both total operating
Sentence 5738: 7.15854186241599
Sentence 5740: here an apportionment say of $5000000  of the total costs to
Sentence 5744: 7.098185761692722
Sentence 5746: but in the second subtype which i take to be the one  more
Sentence 5750: 6.5484560153267966
Sentence 5752: to be sure the capital investments in  the plant and  equipment
Sentence 5754: revenues received from the sales of the different services.
Sentence 5757: but  any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class
Sentence 5761: 4.900359208359081
Sentence 5763: thus during any given year if the revenues from the residential
Sentence 5771: other services will show different rates of return some probably
Sentence 5773: 5.932668809030131
Sentence 5775: there are obvious  reasons of convenience for this practice of
Sentence 5780: 6.482706657363348
Sentence 5782: but the practice is likely to be misleading since it may seem to
Sentence 5787: 5.4897241803631935
Sentence 5789: needless to say any  such inference would be quite unwarranted.
Sentence 5792: for the reason just  suggested i shall assume the use of the first
Sentence 5795: 8.019190568547684
Sentence 5797: that is to say an allowance for cost of capital will be assumed to
Sentence 5799: 7.872567421239768
Sentence 5801: of the costs of an electric utility business in order to simplify
Sentence 5806: 5.602163009530796
Sentence 5808: let us also assume the existence of only one class or type  of
Sentence 5811: 9.420640188772014
Sentence 5813: this latter  assumption will permit us to center attention on
Sentence 5817: 5.262086440614487
Sentence 5819: since the company under review is supplying  what we are here
Sentence 5825: 7.161203170768335
Sentence 5827: in fact however the problem is not so simple.
Sentence 5830: for a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact
Sentence 5833: 9.928002026307343
Sentence 5835: a recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required.
Sentence 5838: the simplest division and the one most frequently used  in gas and
Sentence 5840: capital costs into customer costs energy or volumetric costs and demand
Sentence 5842: 6.29138468634276
Sentence 5844: if this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart
Sentence 5848: 5.163121678757553
Sentence 5850: for example the monthly bill of a residential  consumer might be
Sentence 5855: 6.991417721034758
Sentence 5857: but our present interest  lies in the measurement of costs of
Sentence 5860: 6.626742685067913
Sentence 5862: let  us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn
Sentence 5865: 7.6901410232041085
Sentence 5867: the  these are those operating and capital costs found to  vary
Sentence 5870: 5.083242045036259
Sentence 5872: included as a minimum are the costs of metering and  billing
Sentence 5875: 6.696093201836714
Sentence 5877: these minimum costs may come to $1 per month more or less for
Sentence 5881: 4.7645920265937844
Sentence 5883: while costs on this  order are sometimes separately charged for in
Sentence 5888: 6.726592819681311
Sentence 5890: but the really controversial aspect of customer-cost  imputation
Sentence 5897: 5.469290066905308
Sentence 5899: the preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined
Sentence 5901: 9.430036403335416
Sentence 5903: like primitive numbers in mathematics the entire  axiological
Sentence 5905: 5.898636882953763
Sentence 5907: but what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically
Sentence 5910: is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning
Sentence 5914: it has become painfully clear that the  very attempt to make
Sentence 5918: 7.847253396487836
Sentence 5920: this push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the
Sentence 5925: 5.859074110365147
Sentence 5927: here i think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent.
Sentence 5929: 1233.
Sentence 5930: the simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs
Sentence 5932: 8.157035641407274
Sentence 5934: for if the small group notion involves the implicit  claim that
Sentence 5938: 7.016367880833384
Sentence 5940: the mere exploration of the unconscious  ground of present-day
Sentence 5943: 6.1911212416779
Sentence 5945: a parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation
Sentence 5948: 9.575372008066365
Sentence 5950: philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection
Sentence 5952: 6.367407910234083
Sentence 5954: this involves a sifting of the  empirical and rational elements
Sentence 5956: 7.994071539716753
Sentence 5958: merton's functional sociology may have great practical use in the
Sentence 5963: 4.715509317355069
Sentence 5965: functionalism as a sociological credo is therefore not a direct
Sentence 5968: 6.365727389270327
Sentence 5970: the purpose of this sort of philosophical study  of sociology is
Sentence 5974: it is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise  to
Sentence 5977: 8.018844848075974
Sentence 5979: such a position entails the negation of philosophy in its platonic
Sentence 5982: 5.7929353629881115
Sentence 5984: but contrary to whitehead philosophy is not a synonym for plato.
Sentence 5987: the uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to
Sentence 5991: however  when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences to
Sentence 5996: the notion of philosophy  as queen bee may fit well with
Sentence 6000: 6.095514496605017
Sentence 6002: metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with  nature as it was
Sentence 6004: 11.157379083582882
Sentence 6006: it has surrendered any claims of description in favor of
Sentence 6010: science is mocked for wishing to know nothing  of nothing in a
Sentence 6014: it is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality
Sentence 6018: it is simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has
Sentence 6020: 10.49146609895339
Sentence 6021: 1253.
Sentence 6022: consider the traditional four fields  of philosophy
Sentence 6024: 7.261543109985577
Sentence 6026: it is a  commonplace that to the degree these special preserves
Sentence 6030: 8.06188135958303
Sentence 6032: what is left  to traditional systems of philosophy is in effect
Sentence 6035: 5.654245249855714
Sentence 6037: in this situation philosophy has survived  by separating itself
Sentence 6040: 9.743056835887879
Sentence 6042: the relinquishing  by philosophy of pretentious claims to
Sentence 6048: in the new situation philosophy is able to provide the social
Sentence 6052: 7.947251282487832
Sentence 6054: beyond  this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by
Sentence 6059: in this connection  it might be noted that the theory of games
Sentence 6062: 9.543527831997404
Sentence 6064: likewise  kant formulated the nebular hypothesis according to
Sentence 6068: 4.682905547111112
Sentence 6070: this does not mean that philosophy resolves  the problems it
Sentence 6073: 11.027680812644316
Sentence 6075: but the forceful presentation of new issues for the sciences to
Sentence 6077: 8.038703595484005
Sentence 6079: to those raised on marcel's homo viator  and heidegger's das
Sentence 6081: 7.833253706904074
Sentence 6083: however modesty and triviality are different qualities.
Sentence 6086: philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear
Sentence 6089: 6.626280802859932
Sentence 6091: the ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind
Sentence 6094: 5.584198977541488
Sentence 6096: by clarifying fundamental premises in the  social sciences and
Sentence 6100: 6.046793257967282
Sentence 6102: philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful
Sentence 6105: 5.0091594061022
Sentence 6107: the dissection of scientific theory the examination  of a theory
Sentence 6111: 6.604928934093401
Sentence 6112: 1271.
Sentence 6113: the realm  of science whatever the degree of precision in
Sentence 6117: whatever philosophy is conceived to be its rationalist  logistic
Sentence 6120: 7.196029026127741
Sentence 6122: for some forms of philosophy this very division between the
Sentence 6125: 6.312604101438946
Sentence 6127: bergson and leroy announce  that the secret is the center of a
Sentence 6130: 8.154860344546112
Sentence 6132: this is simply a confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to
Sentence 6134: 8.971206041118126
Sentence 6136: for  as merleau-ponty indicated it is not the secret which is
Sentence 6138: 9.416504865346
Sentence 6140: in this philosophy and science  share a common goal.
Sentence 6143: the hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees  that
Sentence 6148: 6.5515977130091265
Sentence 6150: the mystification of metaphysical systems  does not imply the
Sentence 6153: 6.1336004932451464
Sentence 6155: the  tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize
Sentence 6161: scientific systems and this includes even  the relation of
Sentence 6165: philosophic systems by the very nature of their completeness are
Sentence 6167: 7.198778874655976
Sentence 6169: in addition to the incompleteness of science and the completeness
Sentence 6173: 6.959931780696591
Sentence 6175: the threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour is not subject
Sentence 6180: 6.570956485993961
Sentence 6182: when dealing with the actual relation  of philosophy to the
Sentence 6186: 5.768583696158625
Sentence 6188: certain features we have touched upon
Sentence 6193: 6.290778560527093
Sentence 6195: the objection will be raised that the most important  role of
Sentence 6199: 5.768460878890224
Sentence 6200: 1288.
Sentence 6201: specifically it will be asked whether the real  questions people
Sentence 6204: 8.066707171169428
Sentence 6206: what then is the status of such questions as
Sentence 6209: do societies develop according  to cosmic patterns or are they
Sentence 6212: does society really exist as an entity over and above the
Sentence 6215: i think it must be said that contrary to metaphysical  insistence
Sentence 6218: 11.19925791115224
Sentence 6220: as simmel and dilthey indicated questions of whether the value of
Sentence 6223: 5.8119128086058645
Sentence 6225: such pseudo-questions assume that answers  of concrete
Sentence 6228: 8.18406868512247
Sentence 6230: social theory has no more right to expect results from meaningless
Sentence 6233: 5.888960893337554
Sentence 6235: it is not  that such questions are not asked.
Sentence 6238: it is rather that introducing them  into social analysis
Sentence 6242: an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract
Sentence 6245: 7.331893982877648
Sentence 6247: to raise the added objection that men require certainty on
Sentence 6251: 5.498075971750319
Sentence 6253: for what concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely that
Sentence 6257: 7.095486907174545
Sentence 6259: a philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an
Sentence 6262: 5.23666488506328
Sentence 6264: men have always lived in a tentative world and in suspension  of
Sentence 6266: 7.2569122533878225
Sentence 6268: uncertainty  overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest
Sentence 6270: 5.326519577128725
Sentence 6272: without such uncertainty we are left  with a set of dogmas and
Sentence 6274: 8.400219018728693
Sentence 6276: the functional interplay of philosophy and science should as a
Sentence 6280: a degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition for the growth of
Sentence 6282: 10.813708723159403
Sentence 6284: but neither was the statement empirical for goodness was not a
Sentence 6288: what were they to  do then with these awkward judgments of
Sentence 6291: to find a place for  them in their theory of knowledge would
Sentence 6294: 5.726373782489891
Sentence 6295: 1310.
Sentence 6296: it appeared that the theory could be saved  in one way only.
Sentence 6299: if it could be shown that judgments of good and bad  were not
Sentence 6305: this is the course the positivists took.
Sentence 6306: 20.334890541159552
Sentence 6308: they explained value judgments by explaining them away.
Sentence 6311: now i do not  think their view will do.
Sentence 6312: 10.368578803405029
Sentence 6314: but before discussing it i should like to record one vote of thanks
Sentence 6318: it has been said of john stuart mill that  he wrote so clearly
Sentence 6320: 12.51688530636644
Sentence 6322: this theory has been  put so clearly and precisely that it deserves
Sentence 6326: the theory claims to show  by analysis that when we say that is
Sentence 6329: 11.240501213712339
Sentence 6331: i shall argue  that we do mean to do just that.
Sentence 6332: 8.923546411515362
Sentence 6334: let us work through an example  and the simpler and commoner the
Sentence 6336: 10.125374979086894
Sentence 6338: there is perhaps no value  statement on which people would more
Sentence 6342: let us take a set of circumstances  in which i happen to be
Sentence 6345: 8.000885227806465
Sentence 6347: we  come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal
Sentence 6349: 8.116833964093411
Sentence 6351: there are signs that it has struggled for days to escape  and
Sentence 6354: 9.234232032382986
Sentence 6356: the attempt failed
Sentence 6357: 8.341215694113531
Sentence 6359: as we think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered
Sentence 6360: it was a bad thing that the little animal
Sentence 6362: 8.510625837032896
Sentence 6364: the positivist tells us that when we say this we are  only
Sentence 6366: 7.4411082812347225
Sentence 6368: i hold on the contrary that we  mean to assert something of the
Sentence 6372: consider what follows from the  positivist view.
Sentence 6375: on that view nothing good or bad happened in the case  until i
Sentence 6377: 10.35351239423101
Sentence 6379: for what i express  in my remark is something going on in me at
Sentence 6383: the pain of the rabbit was not itself bad; nothing evil was
Sentence 6387: 7.0471158366080555
Sentence 6389: now  that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows.
Sentence 6392: let  us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the
Sentence 6394: 7.126191845416098
Sentence 6395: 1335.
Sentence 6396: are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in
Sentence 6399: clearly not.
Sentence 6400: 15.594944937291627
Sentence 6402: indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident  of our
Sentence 6407: 5.46007231885016
Sentence 6409: if so then it is clear that in saying the suffering  was bad we
Sentence 6411: 13.212564759804785
Sentence 6413: we are saying that  the pain was bad when and as it occurred and
Sentence 6415: 7.219688575065933
Sentence 6417: the first argument is thus an ideal experiment  in which we use
Sentence 6419: 11.048057435051081
Sentence 6421: it removes our present expression and shows that the badness we
Sentence 6424: 6.281944763543696
Sentence 6426: the second argument  applies the method in the reverse way.
Sentence 6429: it ideally removes the past event and shows that this would render
Sentence 6433: let us suppose that the  animal did not in fact fall into the
Sentence 6438: on the positivist theory everything i sought to express by calling
Sentence 6442: in the only sense in which badness is involved at all whatever
Sentence 6446: 7.490734055108306
Sentence 6448: and our question is is such an implication  consistent with what
Sentence 6451: clearly it is not.
Sentence 6452: 11.928189820845404
Sentence 6454: if anyone asked us after we made the remark that the suffering was
Sentence 6462: 4.971295212623237
Sentence 6464: the suggestion  that in saying something evil had occurred we were
Sentence 6469: if we did not mean  to say this why should we be so relieved on
Sentence 6472: on the theory before us such relief would be  groundless for in
Sentence 6477: the positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond
Sentence 6479: 7.43304005989246
Sentence 6481: so far as i can see there is only one way out for the positivist.
Sentence 6484: he holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of  approval or
Sentence 6486: 7.233226891479716
Sentence 6487: 1356.
Sentence 6488: and there is a way in which he might hold  that badness did in
Sentence 6491: 12.120643333138174
Sentence 6493: the pain in itself was neutral;  but unfortunately the rabbit on
Sentence 6497: 5.548704733651973
Sentence 6499: this way of escape  is theoretically possible but since it has
Sentence 6504: i come now to a third argument which again is very simple.
Sentence 6507: when we come upon the rabbit  and make our remark about its
Sentence 6511: 6.613184097134126
Sentence 6513: but suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought
Sentence 6515: 6.478669021782826
Sentence 6517: and suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that  the
Sentence 6521: the pathetic evidence is no longer before us; and we are now  so
Sentence 6525: in  these circumstances since what was expressed by the remark
Sentence 6528: 6.943964466192859
Sentence 6530: it is as empty as the word hurrah would be when  there was no
Sentence 6532: 10.120428910697212
Sentence 6534: and this seems to me untrue.
Sentence 6535: 29.352099229253493
Sentence 6537: when we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing the
Sentence 6541: 4.710835872769226
Sentence 6543: we should say that we made our point  with feeling the first time
Sentence 6546: 9.5077435902551
Sentence 6548: and if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same while
Sentence 6551: 7.537574229451851
Sentence 6553: i come now to a fourth consideration.
Sentence 6554: 12.626880398769476
Sentence 6556: we all believe  that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one
Sentence 6559: 5.544510884606459
Sentence 6561: broad and ross have lately contended that this fitness  is one of
Sentence 6563: 7.627130553067126
Sentence 6565: but that is not exactly my point.
Sentence 6566: 20.04813221899233
Sentence 6568: my point is this
Sentence 6571: 8.788314684896072
Sentence 6573: in his novel the house of the dead dostoevsky  tells of his
Sentence 6575: 8.410915942656272
Sentence 6577: whatever  the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today

Sentence 6586: most of us would say that in this delight  at the killing of
Sentence 6590: if we were asked why we thought so we should say  that these things
Sentence 6593: 5.6539799967742805
Sentence 6595: now on the subjectivist  view this answer is ruled out.
Sentence 6598: for before someone takes  up an attitude toward death suffering
Sentence 6602: there is therefore nothing about them to which  an attitude of
Sentence 6604: 11.072749685673482
Sentence 6606: they are  in themselves neutral and so far as they get a moral
Sentence 6609: 7.375647301228128
Sentence 6611: but if that is true why is any attitude more fitting than any
Sentence 6614: would applause for example be fitting if apart from the
Sentence 6617: would condemnation be fitting if independently of the condemnation
Sentence 6620: in such a case any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting  as
Sentence 6624: indeed we are forced to go much farther.
Sentence 6625: 12.270278937355695
Sentence 6627: if goodness  and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are
Sentence 6632: if there is nothing evil  in these things if they get their moral
Sentence 6636: to greet  them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral
Sentence 6641: on the  other hand to greet them with delight would convert what
Sentence 6644: 7.753978209307249
Sentence 6646: the injured german veteran was a former miner twenty-four years
Sentence 6650: this resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to
Sentence 6652: 7.286428797910562
Sentence 6654: in any event the extraordinary result  of this injury was that he
Sentence 6657: 8.238266674411097
Sentence 6659: psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total
Sentence 6664: 6.5405366399743325
Sentence 6666: this circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his
Sentence 6672: 1398.
Sentence 6673: the necessary inference as the authors themselves interpret  it
Sentence 6674: spatial qualities are not among those grasped by
Sentence 6676: 8.198056813487872
Sentence 6678: we do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch
Sentence 6680: 11.570436899743278
Sentence 6682: spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of
Sentence 6685: 8.166566807153272
Sentence 6687: the underlying assumption of course is that only  sight and touch
Sentence 6691: 4.958391598343503
Sentence 6693: this is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel.
Sentence 6696: therefore if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is
Sentence 6702: 5.1695071891800115
Sentence 6704: the force of the authors' analysis  can be felt by the reader i
Sentence 6708: what allows us to think  that the patient had no third-
Sentence 6712: what evidence is there that he was psychically  blind?
Sentence 6715: how can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly
Sentence 6718: we shall consider these in the  inverse order of their
Sentence 6720: 12.265526820187853
Sentence 6722: obviously a satisfactory  answer to the third question is
Sentence 6730: the answer the authors give to it therefore is of supreme
Sentence 6732: 12.044144448452037
Sentence 6734: it is as follows
Sentence 6739: 6.291470996684294
Sentence 6741: the  supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in
Sentence 6745: 6.681805800004582
Sentence 6747: the authors insist however that these abnormalities in  the sense
Sentence 6751: 5.346012869445197
Sentence 6753: first of all what is their evidence  that the tactual apparatus
Sentence 6756: when an object was placed in the patient's hand he had no
Sentence 6759: it whether it was made of wood iron cloth rubber and so on.
Sentence 6762: and  he could recognize by touch alone articles which he had
Sentence 6766: 6.299198933199174
Sentence 6768: the patient attained  an astonishing efficiency in a new trade.
Sentence 6771: because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his
Sentence 6776: 8.51852383809026
Sentence 6778: it seems clear  when one takes into consideration the exceedingly
Sentence 6784: 5.9918007265612605
Sentence 6786: and so the authors conclude
Sentence 6795: if the argument is accepted as essentially  sound up to this point
Sentence 6801: but before we can do this we must first find answers to our
Sentence 6806: in what ways then did the patient's psychical  blindness
Sentence 6809: he could not see objects as unified  self-contained and organized
Sentence 6811: 10.341068677090052
Sentence 6813: the meaning of this as we shall see is that he had no fund  of
Sentence 6818: instead  he constantly became lost in parts and components of
Sentence 6823: 6.890469490964571
Sentence 6825: according to his own testimony he never actually saw things  as
Sentence 6829: 5.747270502395169
Sentence 6831: but by the tracing procedure he could  in a strange obviously
Sentence 6835: 7.630158624283312
Sentence 6837: if however the figure to be discerned were complicated  composed of
Sentence 6839: failed him and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its
Sentence 6841: 0.0
Sentence 6843: this meant concretely that the patient could not read at all
Sentence 6850: the patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery  at
Sentence 6853: 7.459773820305406
Sentence 6855: after a conversation with another man he was able to  recount
Sentence 6858: 9.619966038091068
Sentence 6860: nor could he call up memory-pictures  of close friends or
Sentence 6862: 7.118308360432635
Sentence 6864: in short both his own declarations  and his figural blindness
Sentence 6867: 7.533727914227042
Sentence 6869: he was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed
Sentence 6874: he could  not recognize it; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it
Sentence 6876: 8.200736707514775
Sentence 6878: therefore his only recourse was to learn  the shape all over
Sentence 6882: 5.18698805348644
Sentence 6884: then he might finally recognize it apparently by combining the
Sentence 6887: 7.783352347862678
Sentence 6889: this would mean it can readily be seen that again for each new
Sentence 6892: 7.121765966612089
Sentence 6894: as one would  surmise the procedure however could be repeated
Sentence 6901: men trees automobiles houses and so on- objects continually
Sentence 6905: 4.782427601717655
Sentence 6907: dice for example he inferred from black dots on a white surface.
Sentence 6910: he evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects
Sentence 6912: 5.909009505545415
Sentence 6914: and the authors give  numerous instances of calculated guessing on
Sentence 6919: often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly without
Sentence 6924: perhaps the very important question-  what is then exactly the
Sentence 6926: forms and shapes by means of the tracing  movements when he is
Sentence 6929: - has now been  raised in the reader's mind and in the following
Sentence 6931: 5.277288353642859
Sentence 6933: if the patient  can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot
Sentence 6939: 7.800117953792519
Sentence 6941: how then do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this?
Sentence 6944: the authors set about answering this fundamental question
Sentence 6948: 6.915848666227844
Sentence 6950: quite naturally they make the investigation first by prohibiting
Sentence 6955: when the  patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at
Sentence 6957: 8.672286564180547
Sentence 6959: whenever artists indeed turned to actual representations or molded
Sentence 6965: to speak of this underlying view of the  world is to embark
Sentence 6967: 7.7301584124722975
Sentence 6969: at the least  however one may conclude that geometric potters
Sentence 6973: 5.964133532885743
Sentence 6975: their world again  was a still simple traditional age which was
Sentence 6979: and perhaps an observer of the  vases will not go too far in
Sentence 6982: 5.535330184528866
Sentence 6984: the storms of the past had died away and the great upheaval which

Sentence 6989: throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm severe
Sentence 6991: 7.030965030328297
Sentence 6993: in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel  one

Sentence 6999: the ninth century was in its artistic work the  spiritually
Sentence 7005: geometric pottery  has not yet received the thorough detailed

Sentence 7014: outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now
Sentence 7016: 4.837424933957377
Sentence 7018: much which was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well

Sentence 7040: 5.4147442380388755
Sentence 7042: while protogeometric vases usually turn up especially outside
Sentence 7047: in their place came local variations within the common style-
Sentence 7052: attica  though important was not the only teacher of this age.
Sentence 7055: one can take  a vase of about 800 bc and without any knowledge
Sentence 7060: the potters of the aegean  islands thus stood apart from those of
Sentence 7065: these local variations were to become ever sharper in the next
Sentence 7067: 6.880944114051817
Sentence 7069: the same  conclusions can be drawn from the other physical
Sentence 7073: 7.401229121130267
Sentence 7075: by 800 bc  the aegean was an area of common tongue and of common

Sentence 8080: some who have written on utopia have treated it as a learned
Sentence 8084: 6.093656081597252
Sentence 8086: with respect to this view two points are worth making.
Sentence 8089: first it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page
Sentence 8091: 10.304233160642921
Sentence 8093: it overlooks the other fact that it is described as nec minus
Sentence 8095: 6.853641928480741

Sentence 8102: more believed that a man could be both serious and gay.
Sentence 8105: that a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional
Sentence 8110: 6.603967255903179
Sentence 8112: secondly to find a learned  diversion and a pleasing joke in more's
Sentence 8118: 4.800773437968194
Sentence 8120: indeed  it is even surprising in the canon of christ church and
Sentence 8125: 5.943773571418687
Sentence 8127: but to return to the main line of our inquiry.
Sentence 8130: it  is doubtful that utopia is still widely read because more was
Sentence 8134: 6.910725142464559
Sentence 8136: utopia is still widely read because in a sense more stood on the
Sentence 8138: 6.051743225543437
Sentence 8140: and if he did stand  on the margins of modernity it was not in
Sentence 8143: 9.251469489427912
Sentence 8145: it was not even in writing latin epigrams sometimes bawdy ones or
Sentence 8150: 5.696840260430347
Sentence 8151: 1706.
Sentence 8152: similar literary exercises were the  common doings of a christian
Sentence 8156: had more's writings been wholly limited to such  exercises they
Sentence 8161: 5.221902990449824
Sentence 8163: more stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone-
Sentence 8165: 7.810415301301886
Sentence 8167: and the evidence that he does indeed stand there  derives quite
Sentence 8170: 6.598230546198967
Sentence 8172: only one other contemporary of more's evokes so immediate and
Sentence 8175: 7.72117502115348
Sentence 8177: can we discover what it is in utopia  that has evoked this
Sentence 8180: remember that in seeking the modern  in utopia we do not deny the
Sentence 8186: the medieval was the most important  to chambers because he
Sentence 8189: 5.588703887562494
Sentence 8191: to others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance  of
Sentence 8195: but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation; we want  to
Sentence 8198: 6.126180134758616
Sentence 8200: what is new  about it?  22.677757618045387
Sentence 8202: to that question the answer is simple; it can be made  in two
Sentence 8204: 7.828780270395683
Sentence 8206: but it is an answer which opens the  door wide to an onrush of
Sentence 8208: 13.105269881877826
Sentence 8210: surely there is nothing  new about communism.
Sentence 8213: we find it in plato's republic and  in utopia more acknowledges
Sentence 8215: 9.876981374156989
Sentence 8217: we find it in that common way of life h pleasing to christ and h
Sentence 8221: 6.69141149634059
Sentence 8223: we find it in the later stoic conception of man's natural condition
Sentence 8227: this conception was taken up by the early church fathers and by
Sentence 8231: 6.081027325038086
Sentence 8233: but although the idea of communism is very old even in more's day
Sentence 8236: 7.325496292403985
Sentence 8238: we are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other
Sentence 8239: platonic stoic early christian monastic canonist
Sentence 8243: 4.982088086722686
Sentence 8244: 1726.
Sentence 8245: perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity  of utopian
Sentence 8248: 8.549480168129186
Sentence 8250: we will achieve a more vivid sense  of what it is by realizing
Sentence 8252: 10.730475444439154
Sentence 8254: in plato's republic  communism is- to speak anachronistically-  a
Sentence 8256: 9.047975442535272
Sentence 8258: its function is to separate from the base ruled mass among  whom
Sentence 8260: 5.650746150781882
Sentence 8262: moreover  it is too readily forgotten that in the republic what
Sentence 8268: 6.674330339536156
Sentence 8270: in more's utopia communism is not a means of separating out a
Sentence 8272: 6.293307836623727
Sentence 8274: utopian  communism applies to all utopians.
Sentence 8277: and in the economy of the  book it is not peripheral but central.
Sentence 8280: the concern of utopia is  with the optimo reipublicae statu the
Sentence 8284: 6.790628496489725
Sentence 8286: to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community
Sentence 8293: 5.240320169558137
Sentence 8295: the apostolic community  was literally an elite
Sentence 8297: 9.430036403335416
Sentence 8299: and the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of
Sentence 8304: finally the conception of the natural community of all possessions
Sentence 8308: 6.0352088719041825
Sentence 8310: in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of
Sentence 8312: 7.4489019043886096
Sentence 8314: it did not serve to  contrast the existing order of society with a

Sentence 8342: he is a trustee for the common good  however feeble the

Sentence 8357: in  a properly ordered society the massive force of public law
Sentence 8360: 6.134376786444851
Sentence 8362: in all the respects just  indicated  utopian communism differs

Sentence 8369: 10.583829172177266
Sentence 8371: we do not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus found
Sentence 8375: in  a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions

Sentence 8380: it is not merely a new thing; it is one of the very  few new
Sentence 8383: 8.85407928288562
Sentence 8385: but to say that at a moment in history something is new is not

Sentence 8824: the accumulation of such devices however soon had the effect of
Sentence 8826: 9.329718690063466
Sentence 8828: the process of flattening seemed inexorable and it became necessary
Sentence 8831: 6.293482407274422
Sentence 8833: it was for this reason and  no other that i can see that in
Sentence 8837: 8.40862933168598
Sentence 8839: picasso says that he himself had already made  his first collage
Sentence 8842: 6.608654188169467
Sentence 8844: it is true that his first  collage looks more analytical than
Sentence 8846: 11.95018499411066
Sentence 8848: but it is also true that braque was the  consistent pioneer in
Sentence 8852: 7.798869797692726
Sentence 8854: when we examine what each master says was his first collage we
Sentence 8858: that braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal  by
Sentence 8863: 4.575231936727398
Sentence 8865: but here again the surface-declaring device both  overshoots and
Sentence 8867: 9.063763358105355
Sentence 8869: for the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the
Sentence 8875: because of the size of the areas it covers the pasted paper
Sentence 8878: 13.06503371473196
Sentence 8880: literal flatness now tends to  assert itself as the main event
Sentence 8881: the illusion of depth is
Sentence 8883: 5.061022894047201
Sentence 8885: instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and
Sentence 8887: the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness
Sentence 8889: 7.323443848917472
Sentence 8891: the actual surface  becomes both ground and background and it
Sentence 8896: in their very first collages  braque and picasso draw or paint
Sentence 8901: 6.851875011958627
Sentence 8903: and the surface is driven back  in its very surfaceness only by
Sentence 8905: 7.5619610009659075
Sentence 8907: in the upper  center of braque's first collage fruit dish  a
Sentence 8912: the trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed  between
Sentence 8915: 5.934725622977054
Sentence 8917: yet the  violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the
Sentence 8921: 7.816019890583046
Sentence 8923: at the same time the wallpaper  strips themselves seem to be
Sentence 8928: 5.685060518747864
Sentence 8930: thus every part and plane of the picture keeps  changing place in
Sentence 8936: and the same thing more or less can be said of the contents  of
Sentence 8938: 12.48426561568046
Sentence 8940: in later collages of both  masters a variety of extraneous
Sentence 8944: 7.17395119863937
Sentence 8946: the area adjacent  to one edge of a piece of affixed material-
Sentence 8952: planes defined as parallel  to the surface also cut through it into
Sentence 8955: 6.046219493410928
Sentence 8957: all this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to
Sentence 8960: 7.392144884266809
Sentence 8962: flatness may now monopolize everything but it is a flatness become
Sentence 8967: depicted  cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to
Sentence 8972: 5.227113559961203
Sentence 8973: 1870.
Sentence 8974: out of this re-created literalness  the cubist subject
Sentence 8976: 15.839022710561869
Sentence 8978: for it had turned out by a  further paradox of cubism that the
Sentence 8981: 5.924143006945969
Sentence 8983: in the analytical phase of their cubism braque  and picasso had
Sentence 8988: as a disembodied  attribute and
Sentence 8992: in order to be saved plasticity had had to be isolated; and  as
Sentence 8997: 5.821668751334879
Sentence 8999: cubism in its 1911-1912 phase  was on the verge of abstract art.
Sentence 9002: it was then that picasso and braque were confronted with  a
Sentence 9003: they had to choose between illusion and representation.
Sentence 9006: if they opted for illusion it could only be illusion per se-  an
Sentence 9009: 7.544992431196737
Sentence 9011: if on the other hand they opted for representation it had to be
Sentence 9015: 5.4381683460706505
Sentence 9017: it was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear
Sentence 9021: 7.94894832720447
Sentence 9023: in the end picasso and braque  plumped for the representational
Sentence 9025: 10.530728638869983
Sentence 9027: but the inner formal logic of cubism  as it worked itself out
Sentence 9031: when the smaller facet-planes of analytical  cubism were placed
Sentence 9036: 5.615217721960097
Sentence 9038: left in their previous atom-like smallness they would have cut away
Sentence 9043: large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert
Sentence 9048: 5.089574935992049
Sentence 9050: it was  because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other
Sentence 9057: 6.781089267002746
Sentence 9058: 1885.
Sentence 9059: analytical cubism came to an end in the collage but not
Sentence 9063: only when the collage had been exhaustively translated  into oil
Sentence 9068: 6.200461707338752
Sentence 9070: synthetic cubism began with picasso alone late in 1913 or early in
Sentence 9075: but even before that picasso  had glimpsed and entered for a
Sentence 9079: it was as though in that instant he had felt the flatness of
Sentence 9082: 6.425611220251034
Sentence 9084: this he did by using utterly literal means to carry  the forward
Sentence 9087: 8.890041861443022
Sentence 9089: some time in 1912 picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in
Sentence 9094: 4.583650624155594
Sentence 9096: the affixed elements of collage were extruded as it were  and
Sentence 9100: and without  high density in the core rapid-transit systems
Sentence 9103: 5.780015580284884
Sentence 9105: however the building of freeways and garages cannot continue
Sentence 9107: 11.045492157375909
Sentence 9109: the new interchange among the four los angeles freeways including
Sentence 9113: 5.592635127419237
Sentence 9115: it is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete
Sentence 9118: 10.073806918041567
Sentence 9120: as it affects the city's fiscal situation such an interchange is
Sentence 9123: 7.282524625225396
Sentence 9125: subways improved land values  without taking away land;
Sentence 9128: 7.238056180642532
Sentence 9130: downtown los angeles is already two-thirds freeway interchange
Sentence 9133: 5.257307633900222
Sentence 9135: the freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and
Sentence 9138: 7.4566280023606915
Sentence 9140: city planners do not always use this boundary  as effectively as
Sentence 9142: 6.409536690321955
Sentence 9144: less ambitious freeway plans may be  more successful- especially
Sentence 9148: 1903.
Sentence 9149: meanwhile the automobile and its friend  the truck have cost
Sentence 9151: 5.8019468101117315
Sentence 9153: in ever greater numbers factories are locating in the suburbs or
Sentence 9157: the appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry
Sentence 9162: to light industry  the economies of being on one floor are much
Sentence 9166: 6.300809634716768
Sentence 9168: this movement of industry away from the central cities  is not so
Sentence 9170: 6.223081203743542
Sentence 9172: it  is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which
Sentence 9174: 7.95603204054056
Sentence 9176: the big factories which are relatively near the centers of our
Sentence 9182: the leapfrog was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine
Sentence 9185: 7.497288527224647
Sentence 9187: the truck and  the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of
Sentence 9189: 6.040227447879625
Sentence 9191: until internal combustion became cheap he had to be near  a
Sentence 9194: 7.817525253817118
Sentence 9196: the railroad siding is still important- it  is usually though not
Sentence 9200: but anybody who promises a substantial volume  of business can

Sentence 9231: the future could be worse.
Sentence 9232: 13.848082117783294
Sentence 9234: the plants along route 128  are mostly well designed and nicely set
Sentence 9236: 6.727556652604531
Sentence 9238: they can even be rather grand like edward land's monument  to
Sentence 9240: 9.493647800865702
Sentence 9241: 1923.
Sentence 9242: but they deny the values  of the city- the crowded competitive

Sentence 9247: they are segregated businesses combining again on one site  the

Sentence 9271: what hurts most is the damage  the automobile has done to
Sentence 9274: 5.698896856754638
Sentence 9276: some retailing  of course always spreads with the population-
Sentence 9279: 6.928982445761588
Sentence 9281: but whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago- a
Sentence 9285: 4.991884827465006
Sentence 9287: department stores congregated in the  one hundred per cent

Sentence 9301: in most discussions of this phenomenon the figures are

Sentence 9305: no suburban shopping-center branch- not even hudson's vast
Sentence 9309: 8.114174863986696

Sentence 9334: operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their
Sentence 9336: 6.035995758520743
Sentence 9338: the fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are
Sentence 9342: 7.960241431505064
Sentence 9344: moreover the cost of operations  is always high in any new store
Sentence 9347: 6.061537554093685
Sentence 9349: when all has been said however the big branch store remains a major
Sentence 9353: just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the

Sentence 9994: but today we were aware of only two men.
Sentence 9995: 10.293179482668778
Sentence 9997: one had taken a flight into uncharted space in the service of
Sentence 9999: 9.238164636810307
Sentence 10001: the other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted
Sentence 10003: 9.465283274094556
Sentence 10005: the flowers on his grave attested to the  fact that he as well
Sentence 10007: 8.841486798399378
Sentence 10009: these two recollections  form the frame around a series of
Sentence 10014: a struggle that is  being waged all over the world in the half-
Sentence 10016: 11.857226038602619
Sentence 10018: the  prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of

Sentence 10024: the socialist  environment it was stated had cross-fertilized
Sentence 10027: 8.749038374892583

Sentence 10034: i could not bring myself to answer that some of my best friends are
Sentence 10036: 9.979213348330463
Sentence 10038: this kind of  reasoning and logic takes a little time to get
Sentence 10040: 9.321993967558964
Sentence 10042: after a while  we were perhaps less surprised but still puzzled
Sentence 10045: 7.378684693025713
Sentence 10047: a chance remark about lenin's sealed train  brought the rejoinder
Sentence 10051: theories of the behavior pattern of population masses  were
Sentence 10054: 7.604666493087551
Sentence 10056: no wonder that pozzatti and i had at times difficulty  in
Sentence 10060: typical of such an experience was the occasion  of a somewhat
Sentence 10063: 7.264707011585602
Sentence 10065: we had looked forward to what we hoped to be our  first informal
Sentence 10067: 7.5594740825260685
Sentence 10069: instead  we became involved in a series of friendly but overly
Sentence 10072: 9.101534102823583

Sentence 10097: 5.236383152695367
Sentence 10099: unfortunately she returned later just as i had taken advantage of
Sentence 10104: 6.675952771977414
Sentence 10106: this gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the
Sentence 10109: 5.718993643496278
Sentence 10111: she  did not go so far as to say as was done on other occasions
Sentence 10116: 7.402022986230212
Sentence 10118: we were  to discover in fact that quite a number of people share

Sentence 10129: 6.20902340932923
Sentence 10131: artists simply do  not talk to each other in that fashion; and
Sentence 10134: 7.223711590516203
Sentence 10136: to save time some clarification seemed necessary.
Sentence 10137: 9.119587473979069
Sentence 10139: the following  is a statement read to a large and friendly group
Sentence 10140: we have come to your land with the
Sentence 10143: 7.323197769752837
Sentence 10145: our presence here should also be considered further sincere
Sentence 10149: 4.766150547538924
Sentence 10151: we are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future
Sentence 10154: 9.769675206434302
Sentence 10156: in spite of the relatively short period of time that we have
Sentence 10159: 8.439928788414969

Sentence 10168: 7.655753926704058
Sentence 10170: your present history  is equally admirable for its industrial and
Sentence 10172: 8.205142482231215
Sentence 10174: we have come to you to experience something of your way of life
Sentence 10178: while we as american  artists  believe deeply in the universal

Sentence 10187: 6.23367665049665
Sentence 10188: 2122.
Sentence 10189: as a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people
Sentence 10192: 10.013009547019598
Sentence 10194: but certainly all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge
Sentence 10199: 6.177959318434381
Sentence 10201: like yourselves we have pride and love for our country.
Sentence 10204: to many of us this is a land to which we or our parents fled from
Sentence 10208: as artists we  feel the same obligation as do other individuals
Sentence 10212: the sane society is an ambitious work.
Sentence 10213: 8.976097203071156
Sentence 10215: its scope is as broad as the question
Sentence 10218: a work so broad even when it is directed by a leading idea and
Sentence 10222: even a hasty reader  will easily find in it numerous blind spots
Sentence 10226: 6.359052874429053
Sentence 10228: such books are easy prey for critics.
Sentence 10229: 8.771033092947984
Sentence 10231: nor need  the critic be captious.
Sentence 10232: 12.946764411202565

Sentence 10241: 9.516917760745065
Sentence 10243: the thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large
Sentence 10251: 5.203008301938112
Sentence 10253: that could be easily done but there is little reason in it.
Sentence 10256: it would come down to saying that fromm paints with a broad brush
Sentence 10259: 6.7176044642943795
Sentence 10261: i mention these features of the book  because they are inherent in
Sentence 10263: 8.913272091211942
Sentence 10265: it would be superfluous to build a critique around them.
Sentence 10268: there are more substantial criticisms to be made of fromm's account
Sentence 10270: 15.516482489747535
Sentence 10272: it is worthwhile to recall that  fromm's treatment has both
Sentence 10274: 9.47607946111833
Sentence 10276: since i have already discussed his moral position that discussion is
Sentence 10281: i shall  first indicate a couple of weaknesses in fromm's
Sentence 10283: left that is valuable and finally raise the general question of a
Sentence 10286: 5.770037733481585
Sentence 10288: almost  no empirical work has been done on the problem of
Sentence 10290: 10.976418189748117
Sentence 10292: despite  its rather long intellectual history alienation is still
Sentence 10294: 6.454874691434237
Sentence 10296: the idea has received much  attention in philosophy in literature
Sentence 10299: 9.765991470953939
Sentence 10301: what is missing is  work that would answer presumably by the use
Sentence 10303: what are the  components of the feeling-state described as
Sentence 10306: how widespread is alienation?  18.959357004774663
Sentence 10308: what is its incidence among the various classes  and subgroups of
Sentence 10311: taking alienation as a dependent variable  with what socio-
Sentence 10314: considered as an independent variable how does it affect
Sentence 10317: until such work is done there must  remain the nagging suspicion
Sentence 10322: 6.296145276200928
Sentence 10324: i am not suggesting that  fromm ought to do this kind of work.
Sentence 10327: nor do i think that alienation  is nothing more than a projection
Sentence 10329: 9.787607995285752
Sentence 10331: i am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence
Sentence 10334: 6.011835411903733
Sentence 10336: until such evidence appears we must  make do with the evidence we
Sentence 10338: 8.925582376413775
Sentence 10340: here perhaps fromm is vulnerable for he does not always use the
Sentence 10343: 5.640089242660943
Sentence 10345: fromm's analysis of alienation  in the sphere of production
Sentence 10349: 6.0728624714611374
Sentence 10351: for all these  points he relies exclusively on berle and means's
Sentence 10355: the broad conclusions of that pioneering work remain undisturbed
Sentence 10360: 6.57283498824015
Sentence 10362: fromm seems unaware of these developments.
Sentence 10363: 7.622507342753323
Sentence 10365: another example is his very infrequent use of the large amount of
Sentence 10367: he cites such survey-
Sentence 10369: 6.815722888938181
Sentence 10371: moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not
Sentence 10373: 6.98709399282772
Sentence 10375: for example he cites the following  data from two studies on job
Sentence 10376: in the first study 85 per cent of professionals and
Sentence 10378: factory workers expressed satisfaction with  their jobs; in the second
Sentence 10382: 6.922265917285735
Sentence 10384: he concludes that  these data show a remarkably high percentage
Sentence 10387: 6.618347809508719
Sentence 10389: starting  from other value premises than fromm's some analysts
Sentence 10394: eric hoffer  for example once said that america was a paradise-
Sentence 10397: 5.9574180923949696
Sentence 10399: what matters is that while fromm's reading of the data is not the
Sentence 10403: 7.598404158947778
Sentence 10405: fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction
Sentence 10412: fromm says these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment
Sentence 10414: 7.615092762846159
Sentence 10416: that is one way to read the findings but again there are other
Sentence 10418: 7.820346456885255
Sentence 10420: one  might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal
Sentence 10423: 6.921633646929956
Sentence 10425: or he might remind fromm that  the 41 per cent figure is really
Sentence 10426: after all the  medieval guild system was dedicated to
Sentence 10430: 5.2512252661149335
Sentence 10432: in view  of these shortcomings in both the amount and the

Sentence 10439: are people happy are they as satisfied unconsciously as they
Sentence 10442: considering the nature of man and the conditions for  happiness
Sentence 10444: 10.667445180478408
Sentence 10446: the ambiguities suggested  above stem from a more basic difficulty
Sentence 10448: 6.637326681754935
Sentence 10450: he seems to use the term alienation in two different ways.
Sentence 10453: sometimes  he uses it as a subjective descriptive term and
Sentence 10455: 6.112852567754032
Sentence 10457: that is sometimes it is used to describe  felt human misery and
Sentence 10460: 9.555542984138903
Sentence 10462: the failure to keep these two usages  distinct presents hazards to
Sentence 10464: 7.513801238435493
Sentence 10466: it also permits fromm to do some dubious things with empirical
Sentence 10468: 11.838738193581237
Sentence 10469: 2183.
Sentence 10470: when alienation is used  as an objective and diagnostic category
Sentence 10473: 6.38270889009178
Sentence 10475: starting from this  and accepting his estimate of the iniquities
Sentence 10480: 6.032823168715323
Sentence 10482: the point is that in a system such as fromm's which  recognizes
Sentence 10486: 7.275656140464657
Sentence 10488: thus in the example cited above  fromm rests his whole case on the
Sentence 10492: 6.7094122240182985
Sentence 10494: he has his cake and eats it too
Sentence 10497: 5.913908389731324
Sentence 10499: this sort of manipulation is  especially troublesome in fromm's
Sentence 10504: 6.348513592991583
Sentence 10506: while the empirical psychoanalytic  label which fromm claims
Sentence 10509: 5.995390196651971
Sentence 10511: the final example of the failure to use available evidence
Sentence 10515: 7.639212524229116
Sentence 10517: in a brief chapter dealing with various  other diagnoses he
Sentence 10522: 5.20871252147164
Sentence 10524: he finds  it equally remarkable that their critical diagnosis and
Sentence 10527: 7.618991898741296
Sentence 10529: there is nothing remarkable about this at  all.
Sentence 10532: it is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's
Sentence 10534: 16.635251464280763
Sentence 10536: there is a difference between evidence and illustration and fromm's
Sentence 10540: glance at the list
Sentence 10543: 6.632349365895319
Sentence 10545: this is a delightfully motley collection.
Sentence 10546: 21.720414160094613
Sentence 10548: one can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them
Sentence 10552: the method of selection fromm uses achieves exactly that.
Sentence 10555: furthermore  the list is interesting for its omissions.
Sentence 10558: it omits for  example practically the whole line of great
Sentence 10560: whose basic position  is religious and all those who are with more or
Sentence 10562: 6.320878626527629
Sentence 10564: of course the list also excludes all writers who are  fairly
Sentence 10567: 7.986939146490382
Sentence 10569: it is not hard  to find that concurrence of opinion which fromm
Sentence 10573: turning from  these problems of the use of evidence one meets
Sentence 10576: 7.596583429467451
Sentence 10578: one such instance has already been presented
Sentence 10580: 9.53533677413014
Sentence 10582: the only other one i shall mention here  is his use of the term
Sentence 10584: 11.534500564906686
Sentence 10586: for fromm capitalism is  the enemy the root of all evil.
Sentence 10589: it is of course useful to have a sovereign  cause in one's social

Sentence 10594: if one characteristic distinguishes boris godunov it is the
Sentence 10597: 6.523798856294125
Sentence 10599: much of this lifelike quality results  from mussorgsky's care in
Sentence 10601: 9.739721297461733
Sentence 10603: in this he followed a path that led back to the very  source of
Sentence 10607: 5.815391374855542
Sentence 10609: through long experimentation  in his songs mussorgsky developed
Sentence 10613: giving most of his musical continuity  to the orchestra he lets the
Sentence 10616: 4.9495055662483365
Sentence 10618: the moments of sung melody in the usual sense come most often when
Sentence 10621: 7.163114320776924
Sentence 10623: otherwise mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies  for prolonged
Sentence 10627: even then the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word
Sentence 10629: 9.394553212230063
Sentence 10631: aside from boris himself  one need but examine the secondary
Sentence 10635: even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full

Sentence 10639: consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action
Sentence 10641: 6.644249059316758

Sentence 10645: 8.40828673942554
Sentence 10647: pimen is an old man weak in body- his  voice rarely rises to a full
Sentence 10649: 5.589010576882641
Sentence 10651: his calmness offers contrast to grigori's youthful excitement.
Sentence 10654: a  quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appears
Sentence 10656: this theme comes to represent the outer world the
Sentence 10657: realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance quite distinct
Sentence 10659: 4.789029027344989
Sentence 10661: it changes and develops  according to the text; it introduces
Sentence 10663: 10.85864069485859
Sentence 10665: once he has been identified however a  new melody is used to
Sentence 10667: an imaginative  storyteller pimen takes on

Sentence 10672: here the composer uses a favorite device of his the intensification

Sentence 10685: varlaam  and missail always appear together and often sing
Sentence 10690: their begging song might  easily be a folk melody
Sentence 10693: 7.689530745144533
Sentence 10695: apparently their origin is humble their approach to life direct and
Sentence 10697: 6.4837705874630664
Sentence 10699: whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb
Sentence 10701: 9.205094467689216
Sentence 10703: missail is the straight man not very talkative  mild-mannered
Sentence 10705: 5.825820622377272
Sentence 10707: varlaam is loud rowdy uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient

Sentence 10735: for the only time in the opera words  are not set according to
Sentence 10738: 8.550165616409267
Sentence 10740: musically and  dramatically rangoni is as far removed from the
Sentence 10742: 7.214872179278036
Sentence 10744: his music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality  that
Sentence 10747: 6.966023347421749
Sentence 10749: his speech shows none of the native accent of the russian
Sentence 10753: his personality appears more striking by contrast with marina who
Sentence 10756: 2245.
Sentence 10757: rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock a sudden open fifth
Sentence 10761: the effect is as if he had materialized out of nowhere.
Sentence 10764: he speaks quietly concealing  his authority beneath a smooth
Sentence 10767: 5.722903588005325
Sentence 10769: he addresses marina with great deference calling her princess  at
Sentence 10773: 6.4019660578626105
Sentence 10775: curiously this scene is a close  parallel to one that verdi was
Sentence 10779: rangoni and amonasro have the same  purpose- forcing the girl to
Sentence 10782: 6.083151600268427
Sentence 10784: rangoni begins  by describing the sad state of the church; this
Sentence 10786: 5.598483606048827
Sentence 10788: the music becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own
Sentence 10789: it is she he tells her who can  bring the truth to russia
Sentence 10791: 7.127864319617783
Sentence 10793: as if in a trance  she repeats his words- then realizes with a
Sentence 10795: 7.680163033479572
Sentence 10797: this is no assignment for a frivolous girl she assures him.
Sentence 10800: now rangoni comes to the point and we hear for the first time  a
Sentence 10803: 6.477579054244203
Sentence 10805: it is a phrase as arresting as a magician's  gesture with a piquant
Sentence 10807: 11.02243407942966
Sentence 10809: another theme sinuously chromatic appears as he directs her  to
Sentence 10813: coming from a priest the music sounds as odd as the advice:
Sentence 10815: 6.757567981697296
Sentence 10817: her pride is as much at  stake as her virtue; she is the
Sentence 10821: indignantly she denounces rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders
Sentence 10823: 7.198778874655976
Sentence 10825: at once the  jesuit pulls out all the stops.
Sentence 10828: to music of a menacing darkness  he describes the powers of satan
Sentence 10831: 7.470208738340757
Sentence 10833: the combined threat  of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her
Sentence 10835: 6.422408906182968
Sentence 10837: with another sudden change of mood he is again calm and protective
Sentence 10840: 6.505545451539822
Sentence 10842: whatever the source of rangoni's power marina is his captive now;
Sentence 10846: 6.053142088582488
Sentence 10848: the most unusual feature of boris however  is the use of the
Sentence 10850: 11.707622941470449
Sentence 10851: 2267.
Sentence 10852: this is the  real protagonist of the drama; the conflict is not
Sentence 10855: 6.112768918127908
Sentence 10857: mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the  extent to which choral

Sentence 10865: we have a brief glimpse  of the tsar's public personality the
Sentence 10869: 7.718606425518384
Sentence 10871: one reason for the unique  vitality of the chorus is its great
Sentence 10873: 7.440804311787194
Sentence 10875: it rarely  speaks as a unit.
Sentence 10876: 18.949080935241245
Sentence 10878: even in its most conventional appearance the guests'  song of
Sentence 10881: 7.125838474182799
Sentence 10883: in many passages- for example  the council of boyars- each
Sentence 10886: 9.262177519826015
Sentence 10888: hot arguments arise between tenors and basses who will sing in
Sentence 10890: 5.870785048786693
Sentence 10892: the opening scene shows this method at its most individual.
Sentence 10895: mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people those
Sentence 10898: 5.8621295887008245
Sentence 10900: they are held in control by force but  barely.
Sentence 10903: they will kneel and plead for boris' leadership in a strangely
Sentence 10907: 5.311005835378197
Sentence 10909: there is a quick change from the plaintive song to a
Sentence 10911: 15.923983504229168
Sentence 10913: hey mityukh asks one  group what are we shouting about?
Sentence 10916: and mityukh apparently  the intellectual leader of the crowd
Sentence 10918: 11.226761337922127
Sentence 10920: the jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return; then
Sentence 10923: 5.037374730288671
Sentence 10925: mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical  music with considerable
Sentence 10927: 8.581436094141479
Sentence 10929: in pimen's cell the  soft prayers of the monks heard from offstage
Sentence 10932: 5.312532867322121
Sentence 10934: this is especially striking between pimen's  quiet exit and
Sentence 10936: 11.670818393025478
Sentence 10938: again as boris feels himself nearing death a procession files into
Sentence 10940: the words are hardly calculated to put the
Sentence 10942: 4.87298115481748
Sentence 10944: they echo the words with which  he has described his own vision
Sentence 10947: 8.366744007769604
Sentence 10949: the living as well as the dead now accuse him; this final reminder
Sentence 10951: 6.409396413845572
Sentence 10952: 2290.
Sentence 10953: one of the outstanding assets of the present production is the
Sentence 10956: 9.98639453439996
Sentence 10958: though brief  it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy.
Sentence 10961: in addition  it is an important link in the plot giving us a
Sentence 10964: 7.790727819047552
Sentence 10966: the mayhem in the forest of kromy is a natural sequel.
Sentence 10969: the st basil's  scene opens with little groups of beggars milling
Sentence 10973: in the  orchestra we hear first a hushed hesitant pizzicato
Sentence 10976: 6.698442508233473
Sentence 10978: the service is over and a number of people come from the church
Sentence 10980: 11.69045443331077
Sentence 10982: they bring the news that  the pretender has been excommunicated;
Sentence 10985: 5.804269485817031
Sentence 10987: contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment solemn
Sentence 10988: they have prayed for
Sentence 10990: 6.361052125678128
Sentence 10992: so far these remarks like most criticisms of hardy have tacitly
Sentence 10997: for critics  hardy has had no poetic periods- one does not
Sentence 11000: 7.571888905415643
Sentence 11002: this seems odd when one recalls  that he wrote poetry longer than
Sentence 11003: domicilium  is dated between 1857 and
Sentence 11005: 5.6022079535623135
Sentence 11007: one might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years some
Sentence 11010: 8.436592717451486
Sentence 11012: this is not however  the case and development is a term which we
Sentence 11014: 9.096890694722923
Sentence 11016: in a time when poetic style and poetic belief as well seem in a
Sentence 11019: 8.563285666197848
Sentence 11021: though he struggled with  philosophy all his life he never got
Sentence 11025: the  world does not despise us
Sentence 11027: 4.8274065004272115
Sentence 11029: and though in his later years he revised his poems many times the
Sentence 11035: there is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about
Sentence 11036: he did develop toward a more consistent and
Sentence 11039: 8.267871549888163
Sentence 11041: there is only one hardy style but in the earlier poems that style
Sentence 11043: style of another poet or of the fashion of the time.
Sentence 11046: in the later poems  however the personal tone predominates.
Sentence 11049: the bad early poems are  bad shakespeare or bad swinburne; the
Sentence 11051: 8.09953302560164
Sentence 11053: there are two ways of getting at a poet's development
Sentence 11056: 7.736290719947678
Sentence 11058: about a quarter of hardy's poems carry an appended date line
Sentence 11062: 6.964837790668336
Sentence 11064: these dates are virtually the only clues we have to  the
Sentence 11069: with the  exception of satires of circumstance each volume
Sentence 11074: 6.063719690941672
Sentence 11076: from the dated poems  we can venture certain conclusions about
Sentence 11079: 6.2844189372966195
Sentence 11081: the dated poems suggest that while hardy's  concern with poetry
Sentence 11083: 8.112018110528632

Sentence 11153: the second productive period the decade from 1910 to 1920 can  be

Sentence 11172: hardy's two productive decades  were separated by forty years yet
Sentence 11175: 5.074510734093508
Sentence 11177: like a wise gardener hardy pruned away the shakespearian
Sentence 11181: 6.760583683442797
Sentence 11183: the range of the later poetry is considerably  narrower but the
Sentence 11185: 7.518574669670681
Sentence 11187: we  can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if
Sentence 11188: revulsion  and
Sentence 11190: 6.6100764004040125
Sentence 11192: there is not much to be said for revulsion.
Sentence 11193: 28.46342986330878
Sentence 11195: like about half of the 1860-70 poems it is a sonnet  on a
Sentence 11197: 9.812490293835694
Sentence 11199: almost anyone could  have written it; it is competent in the sense
Sentence 11203: 6.3518786607357
Sentence 11205: the language  is the conventional language of the form; there is
Sentence 11208: 7.341668954455712
Sentence 11210: it is smoother than hardy usually is but with the smoothness of
Sentence 11212: 10.046011291162289
Sentence 11214: it is obviously a young man's poem written  out of books and not
Sentence 11217: 11.232402478716416
Sentence 11219: there are many  such competently anonymous performances among the
Sentence 11221: 11.130481812445225
Sentence 11223: neutral tones we immediately recognize as a fine poem in
Sentence 11224: the plain but not quite
Sentence 11227: resolve the issue- all these we have seen in hardy's best poems.
Sentence 11230: the poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on
Sentence 11235: 4.765491282338729
Sentence 11237: the details of the setting  of neutral tones are not strictly
Sentence 11243: 8.75919743257224

Sentence 11265: hardy was not hardy very often.
Sentence 11266: 7.622507342753323
Sentence 11268: the poems of 1912-13  offer a good example of hardy's style as it
Sentence 11270: 8.241635904246959
Sentence 11272: these are the poems hardy wrote after  the death of his first wife;
Sentence 11276: 5.578255752184274
Sentence 11278: hardy obviously felt  that these poems were peculiarly personal and
Sentence 11281: 6.714116470895795
Sentence 11283: they are the only poems that he rearranged as  a group between
Sentence 11287: the elegiac  tone is hardy's natural tone of voice and it is

Sentence 11292: the  view is always toward the past; but the mood is not quite
Sentence 11296: 5.587104705062957
Sentence 11298: the  poems are the epigraph tells us the traces of an ancient
Sentence 11303: 5.873144082615351

Sentence 11326: both of them were overcome by the horror  of the world in which
Sentence 11329: 6.584369483265651

Sentence 11332: 15.370539491984484
Sentence 11334: living in san francisco i saw  them seldom enough to see them
Sentence 11338: so as the years passed i saw them each time in the light of an
Sentence 11340: 10.101773048705413
Sentence 11342: the last time i saw bird at jimbo's bob city he was so  gone-  so
Sentence 11345: 0.0
Sentence 11347: what happened man?  23.610868104840403
Sentence 11349: i said referring  to the pretentious jazz concert.
Sentence 11352: evil man evil he said and that's all he said for the rest of the
Sentence 11354: 10.19542491990246
Sentence 11356: about dawn he got up to blow.
Sentence 11357: 9.264418504214198
Sentence 11359: the rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent  melody
Sentence 11361: 8.649006242526841
Sentence 11363: the last time i saw dylan  his self-destruction had not just
Sentence 11365: 0.0
Sentence 11367: it  had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter.
Sentence 11370: being with him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling
Sentence 11372: 6.380731432796888
Sentence 11374: now dylan thomas and charlie parker have a great deal more in
Sentence 11376: 8.702362714379504
Sentence 11378: as artists they were very similar.
Sentence 11379: 10.86495568007656
Sentence 11381: they were both very fluent.
Sentence 11382: 18.417974109049254
Sentence 11384: but this fluent enchanting utterance had  compared with
Sentence 11386: 8.232402233828171
Sentence 11388: neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture
Sentence 11390: 8.904469603528446
Sentence 11392: the principal theme of thomas's poetry was  the ambivalence of
Sentence 11394: 6.602231030238404
Sentence 11396: music of course is not so explicit an art but anybody who knew
Sentence 11399: 8.50701440888751
Sentence 11401: both of them did communicate one central theme
Sentence 11405: this of course is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry.
Sentence 11408: it is the theme of horace who certainly otherwise bears little
Sentence 11410: 7.456160179316808
Sentence 11412: the difference is that horace accepted his theme  with a kind of
Sentence 11414: 12.803716807082662
Sentence 11416: to dylan and bird it was an agony and terror.
Sentence 11417: 8.786420140744127
Sentence 11419: i do not believe that this is due to anything especially
Sentence 11423: i believe  rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which
Sentence 11425: 9.658946899109276
Sentence 11427: horace's column of imperishable  verse shines quietly enough in
Sentence 11429: 7.032105024464237
Sentence 11430: 2391.
Sentence 11431: art  may have been for him the most enduring orderly and noble
Sentence 11433: 6.578086170536535
Sentence 11435: but the other activities of his life partook of these values.
Sentence 11438: they did not actively negate them.
Sentence 11439: 15.468949783101795
Sentence 11441: dylan thomas's verse had to find endurance in a world of burning
Sentence 11443: 8.622295217086652
Sentence 11445: he was  able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the
Sentence 11447: 8.86346437560069
Sentence 11449: as the world began to take on the guise of an immense  air raid or
Sentence 11451: 9.380083049246991
Sentence 11453: i think all this could apply to parker just as well although
Sentence 11456: 7.309552660892469
Sentence 11458: thomas and parker have more in common than theme  attitude life
Sentence 11460: 8.129673677907498
Sentence 11462: in the practice of their art there is an  obvious technical
Sentence 11464: 10.973968230228177
Sentence 11466: contrary to popular belief they were  not great technical
Sentence 11468: 9.668999315049774
Sentence 11470: their effects are only superficially  startling.
Sentence 11471: 9.316814069021792
Sentence 11473: thomas is a regression from the technical originality and
Sentence 11477: similarly  the innovations of bop and of parker particularly have
Sentence 11482: the tonal novelties  consist in the introduction of a few chords
Sentence 11484: 9.420170092916738
Sentence 11486: and there is less rhythmic difference between progressive  jazz
Sentence 11489: 7.621336873942011
Sentence 11491: what parker  and his contemporaries- gillespie davis monk roach
Sentence 11495: 6.825570308604376
Sentence 11497: this is true  of the melodic line which could be put together
Sentence 11501: it is true of  the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts
Sentence 11505: 8.846349138399919
Sentence 11507: this is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque  to
Sentence 11509: 11.90733603805121
Sentence 11511: it is the difference between bach and mozart.
Sentence 11514: it is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what thomas
Sentence 11516: 16.857931246053788
Sentence 11518: the special syntactical effects of a rimbaud or an edith
Sentence 11522: the metaphysical conceits which fascinate the reactionary
Sentence 11525: 6.374057384651866
Sentence 11527: thomas's  ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves.
Sentence 11530: the immediate  theme if it exists is incidental and his main
Sentence 11532: 5.902564164932943
Sentence 11533: 2416.
Sentence 11534: this is one difference between  bird and dylan which should be
Sentence 11536: 17.43661410097315
Sentence 11538: again contrary to popular  belief there is nothing crazy or
Sentence 11540: 6.573304028508401
Sentence 11542: his sinuous melody is a sort of nai^ve transcendence  of all
Sentence 11544: 9.954970500597222
Sentence 11546: emotionally it does not resemble berlioz  or wagner; it
Sentence 11548: 7.111950423066715
Sentence 11550: this is true also of a painter  like jackson pollock.
Sentence 11553: he may have been eccentric in his behavior  but his paintings are
Sentence 11555: 8.45074812051215
Sentence 11557: partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication.
Sentence 11560: the insistent talk-aboutiveness  of the general environment
Sentence 11562: 6.817408452020724
Sentence 11564: it is much more a personal difference.
Sentence 11565: 25.534126320034105
Sentence 11567: thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder
Sentence 11569: 6.376389380082628
Sentence 11571: parker and pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the
Sentence 11573: 8.979297569300416
Sentence 11575: technique pure and simple rendition is not of major importance
Sentence 11578: 5.826846564016283
Sentence 11580: in modern  jazz the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played
Sentence 11582: 9.034290540572359
Sentence 11584: metrically thomas's verse was extremely conventional  as wa s
Sentence 11588: i want to make clear what i consider the one technical  development
Sentence 11590: 10.278985398086874
Sentence 11592: ornament  is confabulation in the interstices of structure.
Sentence 11595: a poem by dylan thomas a saxophone solo by charles parker a
Sentence 11598: 6.731381435890986
Sentence 11600: confabulation  has come to determine structure.
Sentence 11601: 8.254441635698543
Sentence 11603: uninhibited lyricism should be distinguished from its exact
Sentence 11606: 6.365727389270327
Sentence 11608: just as hart crane had little influence on anyone except very
Sentence 11613: 4.843286672736022
Sentence 11615: in fact his only disciple- the only person to imitate his style-
Sentence 11620: thomas's principal influence  lay in the communication of an
Sentence 11624: 5.6427274801111595
Sentence 11626: parker certainly had much more of an influence.
Sentence 11629: at one  time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in
Sentence 11633: even before his death this influence  had begun to ebb.
Sentence 11635: 2441.
Sentence 11636: in fact the whole generation of the founding fathers of bop-
Sentence 11639: 7.283710886717415
Sentence 11641: the main line of development  today goes back to lester young
Sentence 11643: 10.24550072534126
Sentence 11645: the point  is that many of the most impressive developments in the
Sentence 11647: 10.257535314367495
Sentence 11649: there is no longer any sense of continuing  development of the
Sentence 11654: the cubist generation before world war 1 and on a lower level the
Sentence 11658: 5.665444369780576
Sentence 11660: i doubt if anyone holds such ideas today.
Sentence 11661: 14.345191843103729
Sentence 11663: continuity exits but like the neo-swing music developed from lester
Sentence 11665: 5.236383152695367
Sentence 11667: in the plastic arts  a very similar situation exists.
Sentence 11670: surrealists like hans arp and max ernst might talk of creation by
Sentence 11673: 4.595688357851942
Sentence 11675: but it is obvious that they were self-deluded.
Sentence 11676: 28.20498113366533
Sentence 11678: nothing looks  anything like an ernst or an arp but another ernst
Sentence 11680: 6.18936217805711
Sentence 11682: nothing  looks less like their work than the happenings of random
Sentence 11684: 7.615092762846159
Sentence 11686: many of the post-world war 2 abstract expressionists apostles  of
Sentence 11689: 7.170510863581735
Sentence 11691: the aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random  may exist
Sentence 11693: 9.605882008963722
Sentence 11695: once again what has  happened is an all-consuming confabulation of
Sentence 11697: 7.047649767324945
Sentence 11699: it is curious that at its best the work of this  school of
Sentence 11702: the mother- of-pearl
Sentence 11706: 6.864033054103141
Sentence 11708: often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy- the pure
Sentence 11711: 6.48518912235855
Sentence 11713: you have only to compare such painting with the work of say
Sentence 11716: 9.979619857777196
Sentence 11718: at its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo
Sentence 11720: 8.444373836556068
Sentence 11722: its poverty shows up immediately when compared  with tiepolo
Sentence 11725: 6.885845530166437
Sentence 11727: a tiepolo painting however confabulated is a universe of tensions
Sentence 11729: 6.62197242591231
Sentence 11731: a pollock is an object of art-  bijouterie- disguised only by its
Sentence 11733: 8.121134903484508
Sentence 11735: in fact once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall it turns
Sentence 11737: 6.779142684935131
Sentence 11738: 2464.
Sentence 11739: now there is nothing wrong with complicated  wallpaper.
Sentence 11742: there is just more to tiepolo.
Sentence 11743: 20.465764338977046
Sentence 11745: the great ashikaga  brush painters painted wallpapers too- at
Sentence 11747: 9.69584296187422
Sentence 11749: a process of elimination which leaves the artist with  nothing but
Sentence 11752: 5.3830541283342495
Sentence 11754: so in the last couple of years abstract expressionism has tended
Sentence 11758: anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasions  a
Sentence 11762: hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at finnsburg  and
Sentence 11769: nothing in all this is autobiographical
Sentence 11773: 6.107347697335239
Sentence 11775: since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing  is

Sentence 11793: proceeding from parry's conclusions and adopting one of his
Sentence 11799: yet a fresh  inspection will indicate one crucial amendment
Sentence 11803: the bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a
Sentence 11809: assonance seems nearly as severe a curb although in a celebrated
Sentence 11812: 6.064510266373365
Sentence 11814: the anglo-saxon alliterative line and the  homeric hexameter
Sentence 11819: 4.995286883288707
Sentence 11821: yet certain aids were valuable  and quite credibly necessary for
Sentence 11823: 7.860440992708896
Sentence 11824: 2481.
Sentence 11825: the poet in a written tradition who generally never blots  a
Sentence 11829: but the oral poet cannot pause; he must improvise continuously
Sentence 11831: 10.07298030171053
Sentence 11833: even though the bondage of his verse is not  so great as the
Sentence 11838: the germanic poet had such aids in the kennings which  provided
Sentence 11841: 6.92244967757774
Sentence 11843: either  poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to
Sentence 11849: other synonyms  could of course serve the same function and for

Sentence 11855: verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction

Sentence 11862: limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in anglo-saxon

Sentence 11868: but we can say that since a writing poet with leisure before him

Sentence 11885: the quest of the historical homer is likely never to have further
Sentence 11891: 6.56751093092572

Sentence 13222: thus the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations
Sentence 13226: the last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and
Sentence 13228: 10.052907741076972
Sentence 13230: to effect these operations five elements  exist fixed
Sentence 13232: 9.119587473979069
Sentence 13234: surface forces have been used to provide defense  zones around
Sentence 13237: 7.334849362012845
Sentence 13239: submarines and  shore installations are new elements.
Sentence 13242: the submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense
Sentence 13244: 7.663024046550707
Sentence 13246: fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection.
Sentence 13249: mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets.
Sentence 13252: a sixth element not always considered is intelligence.
Sentence 13255: it includes  operational intelligence of the enemy and
Sentence 13257: 0.0
Sentence 13259: operational intelligence presumably will be available from our
Sentence 13264: the major  postwar development is the certainty that these elements
Sentence 13267: 7.352410900831424
Sentence 13269: thinking on submarine defense  has not always been clear-cut.
Sentence 13272: proponents of single elements tend  to ensure predominance of
Sentence 13276: 6.796698519224445
Sentence 13278: consequently air surface  and submarine elements overshadow the
Sentence 13280: 6.063398628075623
Sentence 13282: these have sought more and more of what they have.
Sentence 13285: each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the
Sentence 13287: 6.6813625361563895
Sentence 13289: this despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are
Sentence 13291: 9.198913718222784
Sentence 13293: thus the most productive areas are  not necessarily the most
Sentence 13295: 8.833286308908676
Sentence 13297: this is stated to emphasize the necessity  for an over-all
Sentence 13302: then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements  can be channeled
Sentence 13306: an over-all concept would have other advantages.
Sentence 13309: it would  allow presentation to the public of a unified approach.
Sentence 13312: now the problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes
Sentence 13314: 12.152571981005552
Sentence 13315: 2803.
Sentence 13316: while one  element  is announcing progress another is delineating
Sentence 13318: 7.321972785933993
Sentence 13320: the  result can only be confusion in the public mind.
Sentence 13323: a unified concept  can serve as a guide to budgeting and if
Sentence 13327: industry's main criticism of the navy's antisubmarine effort is
Sentence 13330: 7.352561550041772
Sentence 13332: lacking guidance industry picks its own areas.
Sentence 13333: 8.762426024314411
Sentence 13335: the result coupled with the salesmanship  for which american
Sentence 13338: 8.506140216384392
Sentence 13340: an over-all concept  will guide industry where available talents
Sentence 13342: 6.2338487675332335
Sentence 13344: therefore a broad concept of over-all submarine  defense is needed
Sentence 13348: 6.637234384017638
Sentence 13350: concept  that which follows will be a discussion of principles
Sentence 13353: 6.109491189080505
Sentence 13355: russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world
Sentence 13357: 10.042467815380848
Sentence 13359: some are also in albania and others  are on loan to egypt.
Sentence 13362: other countries which may willingly or unwillingly become communist
Sentence 13364: 8.26207590452333
Sentence 13366: communist target areas can  be assumed but there is no certainty
Sentence 13370: attack can come from almost any direction against many locations.
Sentence 13373: logically then the first principle of the plan  must be that it
Sentence 13375: 6.646515052475208
Sentence 13377: it is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while
Sentence 13379: 9.995396910362448
Sentence 13381: destruction of the enemy's  building and base complex however
Sentence 13384: 5.693578257441505
Sentence 13386: in  transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the
Sentence 13388: 8.02021381973691
Sentence 13390: the communists are adept at utilizing  hostilities short of general
Sentence 13392: 6.49989374794633
Sentence 13394: therefore the second principle of the plan must be that while
Sentence 13397: 7.262176264192017
Sentence 13399: antisubmarine warfare does not involve clashes between large
Sentence 13403: it is a war of attrition of single actions  of an exchange of
Sentence 13405: 15.861792798818417
Sentence 13407: this exchange must result in our ending up  with some effective
Sentence 13409: 7.250862165373997
Sentence 13411: initially having fewer units of some elements-  especially
Sentence 13415: 6.352388959314798
Sentence 13416: 2827.
Sentence 13417: therefore the third principle of the plan must be that  it does not
Sentence 13420: 5.719195656854624
Sentence 13422: the submarine  has increased its effectiveness by several orders
Sentence 13424: 8.346523409839932
Sentence 13426: its speed has increased it operates at increasingly  greater
Sentence 13429: 5.18742509826831
Sentence 13431: the next developments will probably  be in weaponry.
Sentence 13434: the missile can gradually be expected to replace the  torpedo.
Sentence 13437: as detection ranges increase weapons will be developed to
Sentence 13441: therefore  the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide
Sentence 13445: no element can accomplish  the total objective of submarine
Sentence 13447: 9.76376045036682
Sentence 13449: some elements support the others but all have limitations.
Sentence 13452: some limitations of one element  can be compensated for by a
Sentence 13454: 8.114131125286105
Sentence 13456: elements used  in combination will increase the over-all
Sentence 13459: 6.325311163473002
Sentence 13461: therefore the plan's  fifth principle must be that it capitalize on
Sentence 13463: 7.476488229392695
Sentence 13465: conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solved by
Sentence 13467: 6.210871206873012
Sentence 13469: numbers would be astronomical  and current fiscal policies make
Sentence 13471: 7.391013650626644
Sentence 13473: shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon programs indicate that
Sentence 13475: 6.066941276481856
Sentence 13477: therefore any measures taken  in peacetime which will decrease
Sentence 13480: 6.748802289035621
Sentence 13482: therefore the sixth  principle of the plan must be that it
Sentence 13485: 5.689166266815458
Sentence 13487: the world is constantly  changing; what was new yesterday is
Sentence 13489: 12.321059980898383
Sentence 13491: the  seventh principle of the plan is self-evident; it must be
Sentence 13494: 5.989795157616825
Sentence 13496: to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense
Sentence 13500: 7.369551939108993
Sentence 13502: before considering these elements in more detail an additional
Sentence 13504: 6.791049676473546
Sentence 13506: large area coverage will accomplish all  other tasks.
Sentence 13509: therefore because reduction in tasks results in reduction  of
Sentence 13513: but it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented
Sentence 13515: 16.794073807785615
Sentence 13516: 2851.
Sentence 13517: consequently the system giving area coverage must be flexible and
Sentence 13519: 5.725106139771221
Sentence 13521: since effective area coverage appears fairly remote  the
Sentence 13522: air
Sentence 13526: these are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness
Sentence 13531: intelligence  as used herein will include information on
Sentence 13535: these can  be referred to as operational intelligence and
Sentence 13537: 8.010081924658726
Sentence 13539: in submarine defense these must have maximum stress.
Sentence 13542: good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning greatly
Sentence 13546: environmental intelligence  is just as important.
Sentence 13549: the ocean presently co-operates with the  target.
Sentence 13552: full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the
Sentence 13558: therefore improved  intelligence will result in reduced force
Sentence 13561: 5.406664019112
Sentence 13563: gathering intelligence is important but of equal importance is its
Sentence 13565: 7.391013650626644
Sentence 13567: a program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic
Sentence 13569: 7.17999136448753
Sentence 13571: approaching  this problem on a statistical basis is invalid
Sentence 13575: 6.3268751469330775
Sentence 13577: therefore the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating
Sentence 13580: 5.801816149505095
Sentence 13582: all capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then.
Sentence 13585: temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and
Sentence 13587: 5.90870224590401
Sentence 13589: variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than
Sentence 13593: these variations must eventually be measured horizontally as well
Sentence 13595: 8.40276774381342
Sentence 13597: progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging but little
Sentence 13600: 9.928013458050904
Sentence 13602: a concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on
Sentence 13604: 6.62197242591231
Sentence 13606: mine warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets.
Sentence 13608: 2873.
Sentence 13609: by its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage
Sentence 13613: mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets.
Sentence 13616: they are still considered to be for use in restricted waters
Sentence 13620: mines need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine
Sentence 13623: 6.38769540514313
Sentence 13625: mines can be used to deny access to great areas; they  are
Sentence 13628: 5.790072726947081
Sentence 13630: a most attractive feature is that detection  and attack are
Sentence 13632: 8.405340457262655
Sentence 13634: effective employment  will reduce force requirements.
Sentence 13637: for example effective mine  barriers from florida to cuba and
Sentence 13641: 6.894498875494615
Sentence 13643: more extended systems covering all passage  into the caribbean
Sentence 13646: 5.563375759127216
Sentence 13648: systems covering the gulf  of st lawrence and possibly the entire

Sentence 17022: in addition  the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is
Sentence 17027: this problem  usually determines the lower limit of loop gain
Sentence 17029: 8.823411164925119
Sentence 17031: it must be noticed in fig 7-1 that the accelerometer  responds to
Sentence 17033: 8.799215518229115
Sentence 17035: the equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle
Sentence 17038: 6.673055462121845
Sentence 17040: when the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform
Sentence 17043: 6.985033348206907
Sentence 17045: there are many such components of acceleration present  due to the
Sentence 17049: one of the greatest problems associated with automatic  leveling is
Sentence 17052: 10.838046414385232
Sentence 17054: one solution to the problem is to operate  with a low loop gain
Sentence 17056: 11.399959901557546
Sentence 17058: this technique  causes the system to respond only to low frequency
Sentence 17060: 6.137472201451243
Sentence 17062: since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering  increases the
Sentence 17064: 7.590800568668409
Sentence 17066: one of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the  use of a
Sentence 17068: 9.699383048252644
Sentence 17070: the amplifier is designed so  that its gain is large for
Sentence 17074: below this level the amplifier gain f is proportional  and is of
Sentence 17078: the  effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position
Sentence 17083: 3645.
Sentence 17084: when the system is on automatic leveling the gyro drift is canceled
Sentence 17086: 5.4560684206020245
Sentence 17088: the platform actually tilts off level so that the accelerometer
Sentence 17091: 6.941335705905106
Sentence 17093: the amount of platform dip required depends upon the  scale
Sentence 17095: 9.261350790332987
Sentence 17097: the automatic leveling system described in this section is readily
Sentence 17100: 7.333060553020843
Sentence 17102: the system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits.
Sentence 17105: however the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled
Sentence 17109: this leveling system will hold the platform on-level automatically
Sentence 17111: 7.736817524741486
Sentence 17113: a useful by-product of this system is that the information
Sentence 17116: 7.8076921455580495
Sentence 17118: the leveling process can be accomplished manually and the results
Sentence 17122: the  process consists in turning the platform manually until the
Sentence 17124: 7.032105024464237
Sentence 17126: the turning is accomplished by applying  voltage to the gyro
Sentence 17128: 6.817408452020724
Sentence 17130: in brief the human  replaces amplifier f in figs 7-1 and 7- 2.
Sentence 17133: manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the
Sentence 17135: 6.978177995769431
Sentence 17137: if  high accuracy is required in preflight leveling it is usually
Sentence 17140: 7.04470725452639
Sentence 17142: with integration the effect of a small acceleration can be seen
Sentence 17144: 8.77122911693304
Sentence 17146: however skill is required on the part of an operator to level a
Sentence 17148: 9.496346167982761
Sentence 17150: also it requires more time as  compared to the automatic
Sentence 17152: 7.142947673187237
Sentence 17154: manual leveling is inconvenient  if the platform must be
Sentence 17158: the operator must continually supply the correct  amount of turning
Sentence 17161: 5.805447254345494
Sentence 17163: this process is especially difficult since gyro  drifting is
Sentence 17165: 9.647666702688586
Sentence 17167: platform  heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the
Sentence 17170: 5.396094141387029
Sentence 17172: in simpler terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper
Sentence 17174: 9.668330866206757
Sentence 17176: for purely inertial navigators two techniques are available  to
Sentence 17177: use of external or  surveying

Sentence 17181: use of the characteristics of the platform components for an
Sentence 17185: 7.226079837991202
Sentence 17186: 3669.
Sentence 17187: with the gyro-stabilized platform leveled it can be  headed in
Sentence 17189: 7.049728973261037
Sentence 17191: the platform  accelerometers must be slightly modified for this
Sentence 17193: 10.282317167785038
Sentence 17195: before  the accelerometers are mounted on the platform the
Sentence 17199: a mirror is mounted  on each accelerometer so that the plane of
Sentence 17203: a precision transit  is set up so that it is aligned with respect
Sentence 17205: 12.390238519607813
Sentence 17207: this can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying

Sentence 17224: the images can easily be aligned with a high degree  of
Sentence 17226: 10.93951072137165
Sentence 17228: the platform is turned as required by supplying currents  to
Sentence 17230: 6.578982329721101
Sentence 17232: although this technique is  simple and satisfactory one practical
Sentence 17233: the direction  of true north must be known for
Sentence 17235: 6.928763765787131
Sentence 17237: however  this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized
Sentence 17240: 6.035226674045869
Sentence 17242: in many installations the inertial platform is raised off the
Sentence 17245: 8.799743460193586
Sentence 17247: with this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform
Sentence 17249: 10.34800060135459
Sentence 17251: if the platform is not too high off the ground  a transit can be
Sentence 17253: 9.508385408971838
Sentence 17255: obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since
Sentence 17259: the transit can be replaced by an autocollimator.
Sentence 17260: 12.6078345414341
Sentence 17262: this instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the
Sentence 17265: 7.001786473599458
Sentence 17267: the electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified  and
Sentence 17269: 8.346523409839932

Sentence 20815: 17.82477970845511
Sentence 20817: why should he be concerned? 12.299552866609114
Sentence 20819: rousseau is so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced
Sentence 20821: 6.886249538313906

Sentence 20828: you must be a very learned  man says voltaire to one of the
Sentence 20830: 20.171178207588326
Sentence 20832: a learned  man?  17.297538600737344
Sentence 20834: the bandit laughs in his face.
Sentence 20835: 12.435529358277208
Sentence 20837: he goes to the chief himself.
Sentence 20838: 15.732721694765026
Sentence 20840: at what university did you  study?  17.524513425731964
Sentence 20842: he asks.
Sentence 20843: 21.889553134177078
Sentence 20845: he refuses to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher
Sentence 20847: 11.793252044639841
Sentence 20849: to have become so corrupt he  says surely you must have studied
Sentence 20851: 7.075792144112412
Sentence 20853: the chief annoyed by these questions knocks voltaire down and
Sentence 20856: 6.896559938970077
Sentence 20858: when finally the two bedraggled men reach  their friend's home
Sentence 20860: 6.526302640247175
Sentence 20862: for it is such a distinguished place with such fine works of art
Sentence 20865: 8.089153168043826
Sentence 20867: to voltaire's surprise however their host gives them fresh clothes
Sentence 20870: 5.56944066851265
Sentence 20872: immediately after dinner however rousseau asks for still another
Sentence 20874: 9.011757208240255
Sentence 20876: could he have pen and paper please?  8.261878609047885
Sentence 20878: he is in a hurry  to write another essay against culture.
Sentence 20881: such was the impromptu that voltaire gave to howls of laughter at
Sentence 20886: 4.9157802803829505
Sentence 20888: how cruel!   but at the same time how understandable.
Sentence 20891: how could  the rich for whom life was made so simple ever
Sentence 20896: how for example  could a voltaire understand the strange
Sentence 20900: 4691.
Sentence 20901: this time  as a musician.
Sentence 20902: 12.995411607092887
Sentence 20904: ever since he had first begun  to study music and to teach it
Sentence 20907: 8.533781942407167
Sentence 20909: but his facility in  this genre was not great.
Sentence 20912: and his efforts to get a performance for his gallant muses
Sentence 20914: 11.065566490591841
Sentence 20916: his  operatic music had little merit.
Sentence 20917: 8.254441635698543
Sentence 20919: but then one day while on a week's visit to the country home of a
Sentence 20924: he was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about
Sentence 20926: 7.3535919669018925
Sentence 20928: put a few such songs together they urged him.
Sentence 20931: string them  onto some sort of little plot and you'll have a
Sentence 20933: 6.257543042178702
Sentence 20935: nonsense he said.
Sentence 20936: 13.148092146312546
Sentence 20938: this is the sort of stuff i write and then throw away!   heaven
Sentence 20940: 6.336654291461924
Sentence 20942: you  must make an opera out of this materia l.
Sentence 20945: and they wouldn't  leave off arguing and pleading until he had
Sentence 20947: 8.602138872450183
Sentence 20949: oh  the irony and the bitterness of it! that after all his years
Sentence 20955: or at least appear to reject it!   but what else could he do?
Sentence 20958: you couldn't on the one hand decry the arts and at the same
Sentence 20961: well yes perhaps in literature since  you could argue that you
Sentence 20964: 5.60059243696532
Sentence 20966: but now music  too?  28.39853014633006
Sentence 20968: no.
Sentence 20969: 15.610129252044759
Sentence 20971: that would be too much!   and the fault of  course was rameau's.
Sentence 20974: the fault was rameau's and that of the whole culture of this
Sentence 20976: 7.949663754035088
Sentence 20978: for it was rameau's type of music that he had been trying to write
Sentence 20980: 12.36600500163518
Sentence 20982: these little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender
Sentence 20985: 4.777091308850867
Sentence 20987: he couldn't appear  as a composer now.
Sentence 20988: 10.649390503034523
Sentence 20990: that glory craved for so long was now forbidden  to him.
Sentence 20993: still just for the ladies and just for this once for this  one
Sentence 20996: 7.650518612313837
Sentence 20998: the ladies were delighted and jean jacques was applauded.
Sentence 21001: and everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote.
Sentence 21003: 4719.
Sentence 21004: but then after the little operetta had been given its feeble
Sentence 21009: 6.231716108293974
Sentence 21011: rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite standing
Sentence 21014: 7.492816382770513
Sentence 21016: the ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him.
Sentence 21019: a contradiction? 21.944778634142413
Sentence 21021: bah what was a contradiction in one's life? 7.083181512120244
Sentence 21023: every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant
Sentence 21025: 7.381174635157018
Sentence 21027: rousseau had to admit that  though he couldn't agree to a public
Sentence 21031: 4.897811242155384
Sentence 21033: i'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people  seem
Sentence 21035: 8.462872112817319
Sentence 21037: duclos the historian pointed  out to jean jacques that this was
Sentence 21039: 6.8726567938239995
Sentence 21041: the musicians of the  royal opera would not rehearse a work merely
Sentence 21043: 8.513265273755152
Sentence 21045: merely to satisfy the author's curiosity.
Sentence 21046: 8.29907236975412
Sentence 21048: but he recalled that rameau had once had a private performance
Sentence 21052: duclos understood what was bothering rousseau
Sentence 21055: 4.808070905031883
Sentence 21057: that would certainly be paradoxical.
Sentence 21058: 16.51465128084808
Sentence 21060: but duclos thought he saw a way out.
Sentence 21061: 9.99670844734673
Sentence 21063: let me do the  submitting to the royal academy he suggested.
Sentence 21066: your name will  never appear.
Sentence 21067: 10.488068255839314
Sentence 21069: no one will even suspect that it is your work.
Sentence 21070: 14.30958177424244
Sentence 21072: to that rousseau could agree.
Sentence 21073: 11.129123680875907
Sentence 21075: but now what crazy twists  and turns of his emotions!   afraid at
Sentence 21081: 7.900562692927515
Sentence 21083: and  how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause! and thus
Sentence 21089: all these  emotions were screwed up to new heights when after
Sentence 21097: imagine the honor  of it!   what was your answer?
Sentence 21100: jean jacques asked  striving to appear unimpressed.
Sentence 21102: 4743.
Sentence 21103: what else could i do? 11.591156920054853
Sentence 21105: monsieur de cury was incensed of course.
Sentence 21106: 9.060328853487057
Sentence 21108: but i said i would first have to get the author's permission.
Sentence 21111: and i was certain he would refuse.
Sentence 21112: 17.235246293149178
Sentence 21114: how infuriating all  this was! why had not this success come to
Sentence 21118: now when everything was opening up to him- even the court of louis
Sentence 21120: 8.272651517777078
Sentence 21122: back and forth duclos had to go between m  de cury and jean
Sentence 21126: 5.227211832857009
Sentence 21128: and  of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin
Sentence 21130: 6.808569519310805
Sentence 21132: but they naturally kept his secret  well and the public at large
Sentence 21136: how titillating it was to go among people  who did not know him
Sentence 21139: 8.135915446994483
Sentence 21141: the furor was such that people who could not possibly have
Sentence 21146: and  listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a
Sentence 21151: 6.32719733088611
Sentence 21153: he felt himself now as he himself says in his confessions at a
Sentence 21155: 6.607741319023334
Sentence 21157: and that  was why on the day of the performance when a carriage
Sentence 21160: 10.008590622866036

Sentence 34568: i don't know mrs stowe h.
Sentence 34569: 4.7491506386898426
Sentence 34571: what can they  do if they find them? 14.603889071466684
Sentence 34573: they can't do anything.
Sentence 34574: 13.36930593042626
Sentence 34576: it's silly childish running after them like that.
Sentence 34577: 9.060328853487057
Sentence 34579: but  of course the paterollers won't be of any help not with
Sentence 34582: 4.76581317220898
Sentence 34584: she had swished away she had been gone for  a long time probably
Sentence 34587: 7.125955597219856
Sentence 34589: but then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best cold it
Sentence 34594: she had quarreled with lucien  she had resisted his demands for
Sentence 34599: 6.500029345007494
Sentence 34601: she  felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time.
Sentence 34604: now wait a minute she told herself think about it; lucien is not
Sentence 34608: she  had lost a bottle of opium- but that was on the trip from new
Sentence 34610: 6.61712600782368
Sentence 34612: or someone had taken it during her first day at honotassa.
Sentence 34615: yes  she had missed it after her talk with emile after dinner just
Sentence 34617: 5.427950274147271
Sentence 34619: rilly or glendora had entered her room while she slept bringing
Sentence 34621: 7.032105024464237
Sentence 34623: so somebody else could have come in too- then or later while she was
Sentence 34625: 7.699557171210962
Sentence 34627: it  would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor.
Sentence 34630: it was  not very reasonable to believe that lucien had procured
Sentence 34633: 6.526896965308186
Sentence 34635: he  didn't even know that she was there.
Sentence 34636: 10.648531049792185
Sentence 34638: and he certainly couldn't  have guessed that she would resist his
Sentence 34641: 5.743742669551544
Sentence 34643: no he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised.
Sentence 34646: then somebody else?  14.43160455482214
Sentence 34647: 8418.
Sentence 34648: don't question rev had said don't  invite danger.
Sentence 34651: her skin crawled
Sentence 34653: 6.254122446453258
Sentence 34655: sarah had begun to tell  lucien of emile she had begun to
Sentence 34660: so lolotte- or anybody- could have  listened and that somebody
Sentence 34664: that was not reasonable either.
Sentence 34665: 22.836070195266753
Sentence 34667: the opium had disappeared before emile's death and whoever shot him
Sentence 34670: 5.704609165304231
Sentence 34672: she began to doubt  whether there had been in fact a lethal dose
Sentence 34674: 9.714154428711911
Sentence 34676: so  suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would
Sentence 34678: 5.15576524365156
Sentence 34680: added to the  argument was the fact that while she might have
Sentence 34684: 6.336437769264723
Sentence 34686: it was merely an attempt to frighten her.
Sentence 34687: 14.46262503352129
Sentence 34689: she wouldn't go back to new york as maude suggested; she wouldn't
Sentence 34691: 10.044378826341275
Sentence 34693: but- well she'd be very careful.
Sentence 34694: 7.622507342753323
Sentence 34696: she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense
Sentence 34698: 8.171394947443085
Sentence 34700: but before she left her room she dug  into her big moire bag took
Sentence 34703: 5.46911413810475
Sentence 34705: so somebody else knew what  would happen to her father's money if
Sentence 34707: 8.330529772257353
Sentence 34709: rev had known  all along.
Sentence 34710: 9.118533821976325
Sentence 34712: rev didn't need to break the wax seal read the contract and find
Sentence 34714: 7.198778874655976
Sentence 34716: he could conceivably have wished to make sure; rev loved honotassa
Sentence 34719: 8.13063622690684
Sentence 34721: rev would never have tried to give her poison!   she thrust the
Sentence 34726: and in all likelihood by now  there was more than one person in
Sentence 34730: there was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd
Sentence 34732: 13.125676935851551
Sentence 34734: she went downstairs and received another  curious shock for when
Sentence 34738: 5.286153820897227

Sentence 34744: well then  who brought it?  12.076792408766652

Sentence 34767: 7.735484842834032

Sentence 34791: 7.689274648241199
Sentence 34793: it was dark but dry and cool.
Sentence 34794: 18.575160393141385
Sentence 34796: she  doled out what glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts
Sentence 34798: 5.236383152695367

Sentence 34810: they wouldn't go hungry not yet.
Sentence 34811: 13.133843158043385
Sentence 34813: and the fields  were green and growing.
Sentence 34814: 12.420128637259614
Sentence 34816: can't you possibly imagine what life is  going to be like here?

Sentence 34822: she  sent glendora back to the house her basket and her apron
Sentence 34824: 9.551289296197064
Sentence 34826: she  stood for a moment rain dripping from the trees over her head
Sentence 34828: 6.473005157560076
Sentence 34830: maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from sarah's
Sentence 34832: 9.336189346519962
Sentence 34834: maude had the cool ruthlessness to d  o  whatever she made up
Sentence 34836: 5.542917982132687
Sentence 34838: she couldn't see how her death  could affect maude.
Sentence 34841: she couldn't see any reason why maude would  attempt to frighten
Sentence 34843: 7.187557404882245
Sentence 34845: besides there was something hysterical and  silly something almost
Sentence 34847: 8.065136868315244
Sentence 34849: maude was neither hysterical nor silly and sarah rather doubted if
Sentence 34851: 5.674295354649883
Sentence 34853: yet maude had suggested that sarah return to new york.
Sentence 34856: maude could have shot emile- if she'd had a reason to kill him.

Sentence 34910: rev's face was suddenly  a little fixed and questioning.
Sentence 34913: he turned to george and lolotte.

Sentence 34938: 6.54093796655646
Sentence 34940: now why did i do that? 11.878755024467265
Sentence 34942: she thought  as warm drizzling rain touched her face.
Sentence 34945: she was no schoolgirl refusing to bear tales.
Sentence 34948: as she reached the kitchen door the answer  presented itself; if
Sentence 34952: it might be indeed it had already proved  to be a marriage
Sentence 34954: 9.1684875044315 59
Sentence 34956: so she couldn't choose rev as a confidant; it must be lucien.

Sentence 35055: i'd like to make sure.
Sentence 35056: 7.734564608899882
Sentence 35058: also it's just possible  she might know something about mrs
Sentence 35060: 6.833928345948588
Sentence 35062: aren't you ever going to go home? 6.896026824155868

Sentence 35091: 7.874262680844115

Sentence 35100: after leaving conrad  gilborn had no destination.
Sentence 35103: he simply walked not noticing where  he was not caring.

Sentence 35112: 17.963187923472443
Sentence 35113: 8549.
Sentence 35114: mainly of what conrad had tried to make  him believe.
Sentence 35117: there was nothing coherent about his thinking.
Sentence 35120: it was a succession of picture-images passing through his mind
Sentence 35123: 7.345866721976695
Sentence 35125: the enormity of what conrad had told him made it impossible  for
Sentence 35129: conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him only.
Sentence 35132: emotionally they penetrated him not at all.
Sentence 35133: 9.060328853487057

Sentence 35144: he knew conrad  had told him the truth.
Sentence 35145: 15.499957972613625
Sentence 35147: yet it wasn't so.
Sentence 35148: 19.41154013237409
Sentence 35150: it wasn't  so because it couldn't be so.
Sentence 35151: 14.718704829380005

Sentence 35157: she was the sun he the closest planet orbiting around her the rest
Sentence 35159: 11.716273018375269
Sentence 35161: for fifty-five years he had lived progressing  towards a no-goal
Sentence 35163: 7.017380987871936
Sentence 35165: kitti had come along to justify everything.
Sentence 35166: 9.060328853487057
Sentence 35168: she  was his goal she was his reason.
Sentence 35169: 7.240698345721332
Sentence 35171: he had lived all his life waiting for her.
Sentence 35172: 14.825353590384896
Sentence 35174: not once in the time that he had known her had he ever considered
Sentence 35177: 5.985271672307656
Sentence 35179: he could not consider it now.
Sentence 35180: 19.714635232489073
Sentence 35182: and so he walked aimless again.
Sentence 35183: 13.712121456749493
Sentence 35185: the walk ended  inevitably right in front of his hotel building.
Sentence 35188: the doorman began  to nod his head automatically then remembered

Sentence 35211: except that kitti wasn't there.
Sentence 35212: 14.345513138283163
Sentence 35214: without taking off his coat he sat in the blue chair which still
Sentence 35216: 6.79173550914331
Sentence 35218: at last sitting there in the  familiar surroundings the truth
Sentence 35220: 9.843819290377025
Sentence 35222: who? 15.610129252044759
Sentence 35224: he felt no anger towards kitti no sense that she had betrayed
Sentence 35226: 8.261013827652203

Sentence 36428: 5.427950274147271
Sentence 36430: the effect was as depressing as a gravestone the applause
Sentence 36432: 10.102178510512264

Sentence 38995: since then he had worked at this and that though some said his main
Sentence 38997: 8.349326071772477
Sentence 38999: all this went through casey's mind  in the first instant but
Sentence 39002: 5.6423408877191825
Sentence 39004: for he had understood that betty had been engaged to a boy named
Sentence 39006: 9.871467320798672
Sentence 39008: she had grown up with young jenkins and he had heard that they had
Sentence 39010: 8.851084553096657

Sentence 39014: 12.759026029789597

Sentence 39020: where did you pick him up?  12.04051079364257
Sentence 39022: oh i've known him quite  a while.
Sentence 39023: 8.869713567468498

Sentence 39043: do you approve? 30.23431028108215
Sentence 39045: casey kept  his smile fixed but some small inner disturbance
Sentence 39048: 5.016082875082831
Sentence 39050: he wondered whether needham was going to swear off gambling  and
Sentence 39053: 7.204281936780856
Sentence 39055: none of this showed in his face  and he tried to keep his
Sentence 39057: 8.717725202106307
Sentence 39059: he made a point of frowning of acting out the part of the fond
Sentence 39061: 17.363623885380456
Sentence 39063: i'll have to give it some thought he said.
Sentence 39064: 8.421726563527756
Sentence 39066: you wouldn't want  me to say yes without making sure his
Sentence 39069: she made a face at him and then she laughed.
Sentence 39070: 7.533469760296565
Sentence 39072: i'll get my references in order needham  said and though he
Sentence 39075: 5.640852739535696
Sentence 39077: stop by any time casey.
Sentence 39078: 9.629045873528531
Sentence 39080: he stood up and touched the girl's arm.
Sentence 39081: 12.32918527712499
Sentence 39083: if  you're really serious about working on that story i'd better
Sentence 39085: 5.470833263778384
Sentence 39087: casey watched them go still frowning absently  and then
Sentence 39089: 6.953337243345167
Sentence 39091: as he went out he told freddie the dinner was perfect and when he
Sentence 39096: a taxi  took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his
Sentence 39099: 7.333585661023366
Sentence 39101: because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple
Sentence 39104: 6.178311412935174
Sentence 39106: in fact he did not think about jerry burton at  all until he
Sentence 39108: 9.615621603358813
Sentence 39110: only then when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was
Sentence 39112: 5.7104115345172275
Sentence 39114: even from where he  stood he could see the neatly folded blanket
Sentence 39117: 8.658121233021983
Sentence 39119: then he was striding  across the room his thoughts confused but the
Sentence 39123: jack
Sentence 39124: 13.148092146312546
Sentence 39126: i knew the only way i could beat you was to play possum but it was
Sentence 39128: 7.723893519396546
Sentence 39130: j  the wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan and the
Sentence 39134: the discarded papers  inside were sodden there was a glint of
Sentence 39138: he put the basket down distastefully muttering softly and thoroughly
Sentence 39141: 9681.
Sentence 39142: for he remembered too well  how he had brought back the loaded
Sentence 39145: 6.081676676833635
Sentence 39147: for another  second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was
Sentence 39151: 6.721177813726227
Sentence 39153: it  no longer mattered that burton had outsmarted him.
Sentence 39156: the important thing  was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a
Sentence 39158: 8.175607234186513
Sentence 39160: and that gun was empty.
Sentence 39161: 16.26905287195387
Sentence 39163: even before his mind  had rounded out the idea he thrust one hand
Sentence 39166: 7.713014303320637
Sentence 39168: he considered  them with brooding eyes brows bunched as his brain
Sentence 39172: he said
Sentence 39173: 13.671139498061125
Sentence 39175: he put the shells on the table as though he  could no longer bear
Sentence 39177: 7.56953932012892
Sentence 39179: he thought
Sentence 39181: how can i find him?  13.798694057385854
Sentence 39183: there was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth
Sentence 39185: 11.822757104647204
Sentence 39187: he tried to tell himself that maybe burton  had sobered up enough
Sentence 39189: 8.818807756068935
Sentence 39191: maybe he only intended to  scare the blackmailer whoever he was in
Sentence 39193: 8.594528182897653
Sentence 39195: he thought of other possibilities none of them  satisfactory and
Sentence 39198: 6.418600809631403
Sentence 39200: then as he turned toward the telephone it rang shrilly to shatter
Sentence 39204: tony calenda.
Sentence 39205: 12.292407525564322
Sentence 39207: casey heard  the voice distinctly and he knew who it was but it
Sentence 39210: 6.568293702227357
Sentence 39212: when he heard calenda say
Sentence 39215: it still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had
Sentence 39217: 9.104207350109357
Sentence 39219: you took a picture of me at the corner of  washington and blake
Sentence 39221: 7.363053419052398
Sentence 39223: who says so?  18.948182413671855
Sentence 39225: one of my boys.
Sentence 39226: 29.120826228793916
Sentence 39228: calenda was not the sort who walked around without one  of his boys
Sentence 39230: 8.095513598658757
Sentence 39232: so?  15.610129252044759
Sentence 39234: with  my trial coming up in federal court next week i wouldn't
Sentence 39236: 7.032105024464237
Sentence 39238: who says it's going to be published?  10.730140671535784
Sentence 39240: i wouldn't even want it to get around.
Sentence 39241: 8.581436094141479
Sentence 39243: under normal circumstances casey was a little fussy when people
Sentence 39245: 7.711678106143414
Sentence 39247: even so he generally listened  and was usually reasonable to
Sentence 39249: 10.862515415720477
Sentence 39250: 9711.
Sentence 39251: right now however he was still too worried about jerry  burton and
Sentence 39254: 5.021759007081566
Sentence 39256: his nerves were getting  a little ragged and his impatience put
Sentence 39258: 7.407049836017958
Sentence 39260: i was hired to take a picture.
Sentence 39261: 13.515423079641023
Sentence 39263: that's all i know about it and that's all i care.
Sentence 39264: 5.446579851310273
Sentence 39266: maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what i said.
Sentence 39269: all right calenda said his voice still quiet.
Sentence 39272: but i meant what i said casey.
Sentence 39273: 12.800672623818418
Sentence 39275: if that picture gets around and i find out you had anything to do
Sentence 39277: 0.0
Sentence 39279: you  do that casey said.
Sentence 39280: 9.118533821976325
Sentence 39282: just be sure to send your two best boys  tony.
Sentence 39285: he hung up with a bang annoyed at himself for running  off at the
Sentence 39288: 6.036795224973835
Sentence 39290: as soon as he could think logically  again he reached for the
Sentence 39294: he dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before  he hung up.
Sentence 39297: he called the bar and grill where he had picked burton  up that
Sentence 39299: 11.720742149285464
Sentence 39301: when he was told that no one had seen burton since then he thought
Sentence 39303: 9.816577108211186
Sentence 39305: each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up.
Sentence 39308: by  the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down.
Sentence 39311: he had done  all he could and that was that.
Sentence 39314: and anyway burton was not the kind  of guy who would be likely
Sentence 39316: 7.136059644574391
Sentence 39318: he casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from
Sentence 39320: 9.63016008856077
Sentence 39322: he should have stayed here and  watched burton.

Sentence 39471: 9772.
Sentence 39472: there should be an  excited conversation for somewhere directly

Sentence 39523: silently elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out
Sentence 39527: she threw back a cushion over  one of the seats unlocked a
Sentence 39530: 6.770800824915481
Sentence 39532: poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun.
Sentence 39533: 6.968746590851131

Sentence 39541: they are the most efficient.
Sentence 39542: 26.045838823219967

Sentence 39547: why do you need an arsenal? 13.663388853342104
Sentence 39549: nick asked apprehensively staring at the weapon.
Sentence 39550: 7.14162538120728
Sentence 39552: it's quite possible there's more than codfish down there man poet
Sentence 39555: 4.6855296205937185
Sentence 39557: a moment later moving awkwardly because  of the swimming fins
Sentence 39560: 5.4255342493524354
Sentence 39562: poet nodded  to nick and entered the water in a similar
Sentence 39564: 8.149408063313643
Sentence 39566: another moment  and they were out of sight leaving behind only a
Sentence 39568: 0.0
Sentence 39570: for a while nick followed the  twisting course of the bubbles
Sentence 39572: 10.746666733896244
Sentence 39574: they remained close together their air trail wiggling like serpents
Sentence 39576: 6.793852307633501
Sentence 39578: eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle of the ocean
Sentence 39580: 7.703336839382465
Sentence 39582: clasping  his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky.
Sentence 39584: 9802.
Sentence 39585: there was  nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean.
Sentence 39588: alfredo certainly  must have enjoyed being alone.

Sentence 39594: if elaine's uncle had stuck to this  desire for aloneness he
Sentence 39596: 7.288703696461154
Sentence 39598: yet alfredo  wanted money h wanted money to roam through the
Sentence 39600: 8.783628152824377
Sentence 39602: and  graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in

Sentence 39606: it was an odd combination h a strange pair to stumble upon  the
Sentence 39608: 10.707464937364284

Sentence 39621: that was a hell of a note he thought.
Sentence 39622: 14.304933511210336
Sentence 39624: a couple couldn't even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach
Sentence 39628: if the character flying that thing had gone over san clemente

Sentence 39634: 7.892017203100846
Sentence 39636: behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small
Sentence 39638: 7.549846296533712
Sentence 39640: the fisherman was right  in the middle of the deep.
Sentence 39643: nick recalled stories that the two best  fishing spots in
Sentence 39647: 6.044299927214209
Sentence 39649: someday geologists  had warned the land on both sides of these

Sentence 39656: sometimes the fish exploded as they neared the surface because of
Sentence 39658: 8.405989892004232
Sentence 39660: why he wondered had elaine wanted him along on this trip?
Sentence 39663: he couldn't skindive he couldn't run a boat except on the open
Sentence 39665: 5.825820622377272
Sentence 39667: he stood up stretched looked around for the bubbles but could see
Sentence 39669: 9.176540466704445
Sentence 39671: strolling down to the galley he lit the butane under the
Sentence 39674: 5.290027356459293

Sentence 39684: he sat up and watched as they pulled  themselves over the stern.
Sentence 39687: poet shook his head sliding his face mask up on his forehead.
Sentence 39689: 9830.
Sentence 39690: we're right on the edge of the deep elaine said.
Sentence 39693: pulling  off her face mask she carefully placed the spear gun
Sentence 39696: 4.76581317220898
Sentence 39698: which is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile
Sentence 39700: 6.533109828340079
Sentence 39702: any news?  15.009412063232862
Sentence 39704: not a thing.
Sentence 39705: 13.148092146312546
Sentence 39707: he tossed her a towel then repeated the  service for poet.
Sentence 39710: cigarette? 19.804021762487697
Sentence 39712: elaine shook her head  as she slipped out of her harness but
Sentence 39714: 5.969802314021069
Sentence 39716: his feet still hung  over the stern of the transom but as he
Sentence 39720: the fin on his foot caught on the moulding  throwing him off
Sentence 39722: 6.817408452020724
Sentence 39724: his forearm smashed painfully into the narrow washboard and he
Sentence 39727: 6.409188347120729
Sentence 39729: kee-reist! the  word hissed distinctly from poet's lips as he
Sentence 39731: 5.674295354649883
Sentence 39733: turning slowly he saw poet  in a brilliant glare of horror.
Sentence 39736: poet! his face was still creased in  pain as he studied the
Sentence 39738: 6.076559550927458
Sentence 39740: poet a murderer? 13.148092146312546
Sentence 39742: turning  quickly toward elaine nick saw that she too stood in
Sentence 39744: 6.002446559592496
Sentence 39746: the sudden silence was too silent.
Sentence 39747: 12.435529358277208
Sentence 39749: instinctively  aware of the charged atmosphere poet raised his
Sentence 39751: 5.674295354649883
Sentence 39753: she had caught the implication of the oath.
Sentence 39754: 13.744732884676733
Sentence 39756: her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin her body
Sentence 39758: 6.183003451448296
Sentence 39760: and then nick knew that all of them knew h elaine himself h and
Sentence 39762: 12.179334267186501
Sentence 39764: elaine recovered first so quickly that nick thought he might have
Sentence 39766: 6.564895438829204
Sentence 39768: do  you need a bandage?  12.886172342385436
Sentence 39770: she asked steadily.
Sentence 39771: 23.0547882925987
Sentence 39773: it's like banging a shin he said his eyes lingered on nick's face
Sentence 39775: 4.210250940207141
Sentence 39777: hurts like hell for  a second then it disappears.
Sentence 39778: 6.764147616291221
Sentence 39780: elaine turned and started toward the companionway.
Sentence 39781: 9.799821426480841
Sentence 39783: but her walk  was too steady too slow telegraphing her fear.
Sentence 39786: so did poet.
Sentence 39787: 21.219408643065556
Sentence 39789: springing like a cat he leaped back swooped up the spring gun and
Sentence 39791: 5.15576524365156
Sentence 39793: at the same  instant nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon
Sentence 39795: 9.91192618671525
Sentence 39797: the gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first
Sentence 39799: 5.670580783382225
Sentence 39801: at the same instant elaine screamed wildly  the sound ending
Sentence 39804: 9.775915445011245
Sentence 39805: 9863.
Sentence 39806: the moment the  sea closed over nick some atavistic sense warned
Sentence 39809: 6.541385697111927
Sentence 39811: but the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage.
Sentence 39814: the wide flippers  on poet's feet gave his legs incredible power
Sentence 39817: 5.411135972127183
Sentence 39819: poet was the captured arms pinioned to his side and he twisted
Sentence 39821: 7.032105024464237
Sentence 39823: poet would escape nick thought grimly because he wore the
Sentence 39825: 5.236383152695367
Sentence 39827: but nick would  not let go.
Sentence 39828: 16.181449055670814
Sentence 39830: the rubber and glass face mask slipped from poet's forehead bounced
Sentence 39832: 6.040227447879625
Sentence 39834: poet twisted again and nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank
Sentence 39836: 0.0
Sentence 39838: for a split second nick relaxed his grip and poet's  slippery
Sentence 39841: 5.947506138900282
Sentence 39843: something flailed at the side of nick's head as they rolled around
Sentence 39845: 7.82065044720888
Sentence 39847: suddenly poet  stopped struggling and the two of them hung
Sentence 39849: 7.539041506834666
Sentence 39851: a sharp pain lanced across nick's chest and  a bubble of air
Sentence 39856: a black snake-like object swayed eerily in front of  him spewing
Sentence 39858: 5.901300571347011
Sentence 39860: the air hose was free! the discovery struck nick like a blow.
Sentence 39863: desperately nick flashed one hand up catching poet's neck in the
Sentence 39865: 5.542917982132687
Sentence 39867: at the same instant he grabbed the loose writhing hose with his
Sentence 39871: instinctively  he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air
Sentence 39873: 6.357828940933421
Sentence 39875: at  once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was
Sentence 39877: 8.009492186306446
Sentence 39879: as if this was a signal poet abruptly  began to thrash the water
Sentence 39883: relentlessly nick held on sucking on the  hose inhaling the air
Sentence 39885: 7.032105024464237
Sentence 39887: poet was not fighting nick now.

Sentence 41547: 8.581436094141479

Sentence 41578: 10.36845009879809

Sentence 41615: he was beginning to feel woolly.
Sentence 41616: 10.649951465826932

Sentence 41630: he says the neighbors complain  but i don't believe it.
Sentence 41633: why don't they tell me themselves if it  bothers them?

Sentence 43434: he had already become used to hesperus' snapping back answers
Sentence 43438: there  was nothing he could do but wait.
Sentence 43439: 8.923219809040408
Sentence 43441: at  last gabriel spoke.
Sentence 43442: 13.148092146312546
Sentence 43444: we misjudged you he said slowly.
Sentence 43445: 10.717432709549398
Sentence 43447: we had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had
Sentence 43449: 9.411182198381992
Sentence 43451: of course we have before us the example of the great races at the

Sentence 43460: we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by
Sentence 43462: 7.970495892540978
Sentence 43464: for now it is clear  that we were in the wrong.
Sentence 43467: you may reclaim your property and the penalty on hesperus is
Sentence 43469: 9.242266870568722
Sentence 43471: i  did not perceive this essential distinction either first-born
Sentence 43474: 6.602504042024367
Sentence 43476: nevertheless you were its  agent.
Sentence 43477: 11.11483049001212
Sentence 43479: jack what is the nature of this concept?  13.86513856163982
Sentence 43481: it's  a kind of agreement in which each party gives something
Sentence 43483: 5.542917982132687
Sentence 43485: we regard it as fair only when each party feels  that what he has
Sentence 43489: his heart he discovered was pounding.
Sentence 43490: 9.235400264666348
Sentence 43492: for instance hesperus agreed to help me find my property and i
Sentence 43494: 7.513561455654996
Sentence 43496: between individuals this process is called  bargaining.

Sentence 43503: and the major part of my mission to your nest is to  make a
Sentence 43505: 7.484009081100845
Sentence 43507: recovering the property was  much less important.
Sentence 43510: and apparently impossible.

Sentence 43513: though it might be that we would have much to  give you you have
Sentence 43515: 11.094116013052464
Sentence 43517: hesperus and lucifer jack said show that we do.
Sentence 43518: 6.764147616291221
Sentence 43520: another pause; but this one was not nearly as long.
Sentence 43523: then it is a matter of  pleasure; of curiosity; of a more alive
Sentence 43525: 14.373985640214492
Sentence 43527: yes those could be commodities under this concept.

Sentence 43532: 8.283635008922003
Sentence 43534: visiting  the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of
Sentence 43536: 10.78831962583174
Sentence 43538: this explained a great deal.
Sentence 43539: 11.309843967689007
Sentence 43540: 10914.
Sentence 43541: all the more reason  then jack said why we must have a treaty.
Sentence 43544: we will gladly entertain  your young and give them proper living
Sentence 43548: but we must know if this  is in accordance with your customs and
Sentence 43551: 7.953229150945037
Sentence 43553: but this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the
Sentence 43557: to this we  of course agree.

Sentence 43562: 5.8816751717433835
Sentence 43564: what gabriel was asking  was that mankind forego all its
Sentence 43569: the angels in turn would exercise  similar restraints in
Sentence 43574: 5.045119849433976
Sentence 43576: the simple treaty principle  that gabriel was asking him to
Sentence 43578: 8.901660027869564
Sentence 43580: and it might  be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels
Sentence 43584: 5.854493217679945
Sentence 43586: furthermore even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of
Sentence 43589: 6.921684858431951
Sentence 43591: almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward  suspicion
Sentence 43595: yet there was some precedent for it.
Sentence 43596: 14.319941035478317
Sentence 43598: the history of disarmament agreements for instance had been
Sentence 43603: 6.002904610295051
Sentence 43605: out of that agreement though not by any easy  road eventually
Sentence 43610: 7.427094716615564
Sentence 43612: besides  agreements in principle with the petty details to be
Sentence 43616: the trouble with  them was that they almost never worked and in
Sentence 43621: suppose that this one were to work?  9.127449882314659
Sentence 43623: there was no question in jack's mind of the good faith on one side
Sentence 43625: 16.012429851565877
Sentence 43627: if mankind could be convinced of that h  it was worth trying.
Sentence 43630: in fact it had to be tried.
Sentence 43631: 24.98576663201377
Sentence 43632: 10935.
Sentence 43633: it would  be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that
Sentence 43635: 7.950739728011832
Sentence 43637: secretary hart had taught jack at least partially to  be content
Sentence 43640: 7.002504151625705
Sentence 43642: he turned back to the screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his
Sentence 43644: 7.9256312140364
Sentence 43646: but he was too late.
Sentence 43647: 27.657270061307578
Sentence 43649: he had lost his audience.
Sentence 43650: 15.6306526737611
Sentence 43652: for a moment he could make no  sense at all of what he saw.
Sentence 43655: it seemed to be only a riot of color light  and meaningless
Sentence 43657: 11.848590042306634
Sentence 43659: gradually he realized that the pentagon  of angel elders had
Sentence 43662: 7.334172383305516
Sentence 43664: the angels in the nursery were zigzagging  wildly in all
Sentence 43666: 0.0
Sentence 43668: hesperus! what's going on here? 11.568363037656766
Sentence 43670: what's happened?  8.401180936029741
Sentence 43672: your  brothers have been found.
Sentence 43673: 11.568363037656766
Sentence 43675: they are on their way here.
Sentence 43676: 17.082094893376148
Sentence 43678: where?  19.804021762487697
Sentence 43680: i don't see them.
Sentence 43681: 6.084341628539399
Sentence 43683: the instruments don't show them.
Sentence 43684: 13.848082117783294
Sentence 43686: you can't see them yet jack.
Sentence 43687: 6.367225191385647
Sentence 43689: they'll be in range  in a short while.
Sentence 43690: 6.6289753843903
Sentence 43692: jack scanned the skies the boards and the skies again.
Sentence 43695: no- there was a tiny pip on the radar;  and it was getting
Sentence 43697: 8.251252432117036
Sentence 43699: if that was the skiff it was making  unprecedented speed.
Sentence 43700: 0.0
Sentence 43702: then the skiff hove into sight just  a dot of light at first
Sentence 43706: through the telescope jack could see that  both spacesuits were
Sentence 43708: 7.129445514922139
Sentence 43710: the sail was still unfurled  though there were a good many
Sentence 43714: it was a startling almost numenous  sight; but even more awesome
Sentence 43718: the skiff was not heading  for the nursery however.
Sentence 43721: it seemed unlikely that her crew if either  of them were alive
Sentence 43724: 5.9127764110214756
Sentence 43726: and there would be no chance of signaling them- without the nernst
Sentence 43730: 7.416799495565291
Sentence 43732: fuming helpless he watched them pass him.
Sentence 43733: 7.14162538120728
Sentence 43735: the sail ragged though it was still had enough surface to catch
Sentence 43739: he would never have believed  without seeing it that the
Sentence 43741: 8.729608424786454
Sentence 43743: but where was it going?  19.49450951439212
Sentence 43744: 10967.
Sentence 43745: and why was it causing so much agitation among the angels and
Sentence 43748: there was only one possible answer but jack's horrified mind
Sentence 43751: 6.400585945516949
Sentence 43753: the curve on the card the computer  spat back at him couldn't be
Sentence 43755: 6.196120048044738
Sentence 43757: the skiff was headed for the very center of the nebula- toward
Sentence 43760: 7.749943859944991
Sentence 43762: it was clear that langer  had at last found a way to attract the
Sentence 43764: 11.43902686201217
Sentence 43766: it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off.
Sentence 43769: langer would have to be headed off whether  he knew where he was
Sentence 43771: 10.264992231772533
Sentence 43773: almost surely he did; after all he had had the same set of facts
Sentence 43776: 6.333234254760902
Sentence 43778: but not having talked to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his
Sentence 43780: 7.905415341781941
Sentence 43782: had he decided perhaps that the center of the cloud  was a
Sentence 43786: but it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the holy
Sentence 43790: if  it was intentional it was now also unnecessary; and whether
Sentence 43792: 6.748510665599446
Sentence 43794: jack crawled under  the boards and restored the six feet of lead
Sentence 43796: 5.121869688821158
Sentence 43798: when he was back on his feet again  and about to reinstall the
Sentence 43800: 10.637525725885334
Sentence 43802: he had  to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he
Sentence 43804: 8.713290499555995
Sentence 43806: but fusion power in the coal sack was what had triggered  all
Sentence 43810: i'm going to turn my generator back on as i promised to do.
Sentence 43813: but i can't  take you to earth yet.
Sentence 43814: 16.239762984882013
Sentence 43816: first i've got to intercept my brothers  before they get any
Sentence 43818: 6.511591705507893
Sentence 43820: will you obstruct this  or will you help?
Sentence 43823: i know it's not part of the bargain and your  elders might not
Sentence 43825: 8.546495096048107
Sentence 43827: nobody else can live in your  hearth while i am in it hesperus
Sentence 43829: 7.78190563939677
Sentence 43831: as for my elders  they have already admitted that they were
Sentence 43833: 9.42680368706412
Sentence 43835: if because of  this incident they become angry with earth i will
Sentence 43837: 8.856021111336474
Sentence 43839: therefore of course i will help.
Sentence 43840: 10.886199914602827
Sentence 43842: with a short-lived sigh of relief jack plugged the fuses back in
Sentence 43844: 7.032105024464237
Sentence 43846: without an instant's transition the green light that  meant full
Sentence 43848: 5.771383279736075
Sentence 43850: always before it had taken five minutes to-   of course.
Sentence 43852: 10995.
Sentence 43853: from here on out the ariadne was going to be hotter than any space
Sentence 43855: 6.320077487249449
Sentence 43857: but since he had failed to anticipate it he lost the five minutes
Sentence 43859: 9.409014824555035
Sentence 43861: hesperus don't use this t-tau vector  trick of yours please.
Sentence 43864: ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow.
Sentence 43867: he rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw.
Sentence 43868: 9.026368296067464
Sentence 43870: ekstrohm nogol you guys  okay? 11.568363037656766
Sentence 43872: nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured  nogol said.
Sentence 43875: he didn't say what would cure him; he had been  explaining all
Sentence 43879: his small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face.
Sentence 43882: well let's  take a ground-level look at the country around
Sentence 43884: 11.588680584333435
Sentence 43886: the facsiport rolled open on the landscape.
Sentence 43887: 8.976097203071156
Sentence 43889: a range of bluffs  hugged the horizon the color of decaying
Sentence 43891: 10.601977221576893
Sentence 43893: above them the sky  was the black of space or the almost equal
Sentence 43897: that cold empty sky was  full of fire and light.
Sentence 43900: it seemed almost a magnification of the galaxy  itself of the
Sentence 43902: 7.5397878010045
Sentence 43904: this fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets
Sentence 43908: these  planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding
Sentence 43910: 6.002446559592496
Sentence 43912: but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all
Sentence 43914: 10.928600126034778
Sentence 43916: this would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids  of
Sentence 43918: 9.177731967121193
Sentence 43920: they lay months away from the nearest earth star by jump drive and
Sentence 43926: how can a planet with so many neighbors  be so lonely?
Sentence 43929: ryan asked.
Sentence 43930: 15.594944937291627
Sentence 43932: he was the captain so he could  ask questions like that.
Sentence 43935: some can be lonely in a crowd  nogol said elaborately.
Sentence 43938: what will we need outside ryan? 10.34648963827048
Sentence 43940: ekstrohm asked.
Sentence 43941: 15.594944937291627
Sentence 43943: no helmets the captain answered.
Sentence 43944: 10.628794361170721
Sentence 43946: we can breathe out there all right.
Sentence 43947: 15.139777690503488
Sentence 43949: it just won't be easy.
Sentence 43950: 14.93623902024112
Sentence 43952: this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago.
Sentence 43955: nitrogen  and oxygen are about it.
Sentence 43956: 8.254441635698543
Sentence 43958: ryan look over there nogol said.
Sentence 43959: 10.472119682746735

Sentence 43962: 11028.
Sentence 43963: i think they're dead ekstrohm interjected quietly.
Sentence 43966: i get no readings from them at all.
Sentence 43967: 9.169644675936961
Sentence 43969: sonic  electronic galvanic- all blank.

Sentence 43972: according to these needles they're  stone dead.
Sentence 43975: ekstrohm you and i will have a look  ryan said.

Sentence 44005: 10.94873513418626
Sentence 44007: ekstrohm  smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with
Sentence 44009: 5.391783373294707
Sentence 44011: the strong negative field  his suit set up would help to repel
Sentence 44013: 8.174413315489243
Sentence 44015: actually  the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded

Sentence 44035: 7.446409008128629
Sentence 44037: ekstrohm nudged it with a boot.
Sentence 44038: 11.417277206425638
Sentence 44040: hey this is pretty close  to a wart-hog.
Sentence 44041: 7.14162538120728
Sentence 44043: one of the  best matches i've ever found.
Sentence 44046: well it has to happen.
Sentence 44047: 14.387055325262873
Sentence 44049: still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or
Sentence 44051: 8.314697679054335
Sentence 44053: it makes  you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some
Sentence 44057: the surveyor looked sidewise at the captain.
Sentence 44058: 9.670406878971576
Sentence 44060: the big man seldom  gave out with such thoughts.
Sentence 44061: 9.058583833820324
Sentence 44063: what shall  we do with this one?  13.126227377958582
Sentence 44065: dissect it?  12.292407525564322
Sentence 44067: ryan nudged it with  his toe following ekstrohm's example.
Sentence 44070: it sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species

Sentence 44074: no hands for one thing.
Sentence 44075: 13.484377447423066

Sentence 44087: in the meantime we might be thinking on  the problem all these
Sentence 44089: 11.611933442411688
Sentence 44091: what killed them?  16.035421498336767
Sentence 44093: it looks like we did when we made blastdown.
Sentence 44094: 8.196044167676531
Sentence 44096: but what about our landing was lethal to the creatures?
Sentence 44099: radiation? 19.804021762487697
Sentence 44101: ekstrohm suggested.
Sentence 44102: 12.292407525564322
Sentence 44104: the planet is very low  in radiation from mineral deposits and
Sentence 44108: any little dose of radiation might knock  off these critters.
Sentence 44111: i don't know about that.
Sentence 44112: 6.0964767090762
Sentence 44114: maybe  it would work the other way.
Sentence 44115: 7.622507342753323
Sentence 44117: maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and
Sentence 44121: then maybe it was the shockwave we set up.
Sentence 44122: 8.20532328403787
Sentence 44124: or maybe it's sheer xenophobia.
Sentence 44125: 12.833041965406032
Sentence 44127: they curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien-
Sentence 44129: 6.376876511860498
Sentence 44131: at this stage  of the game anything could be possible.
Sentence 44134: but there's one possibility  i particularly don't like.
Sentence 44137: and that is?  31.457922823996512
Sentence 44139: suppose it was not us that killed these aliens.
Sentence 44142: suppose it is something  right on the planet native to it.
Sentence 44145: i just hope it doesn't work  on earthmen too.
Sentence 44146: 10.41765113989062
Sentence 44148: these critters went real sudden.
Sentence 44149: 12.678917125559895
Sentence 44151: ekstrohm  lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet.
Sentence 44154: the earthmen made camp outside the spaceship.
Sentence 44155: 9.670406878971576
Sentence 44157: there was no reason to leave  the comfortable quarters inside
Sentence 44160: 7.394625013199234
Sentence 44162: the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy web
Sentence 44164: 7.34666920488753

Sentence 44177: insects there were on the world but they were frozen solid during
Sentence 44179: 7.108551420335513
Sentence 44181: the bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the
Sentence 44183: 6.374057384651866
Sentence 44185: yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly now that they
Sentence 44188: 7.4797049856303435
Sentence 44190: now there could be an end to pretending.
Sentence 44191: 11.385006813316828
Sentence 44193: he threw off the light blanket and swung  his feet off the bunk
Sentence 44195: 9.112998257296404
Sentence 44197: there  was no longer any need to hide.
Sentence 44198: 8.871998250907023

Sentence 44211: it was small comfort for insomnia.
Sentence 44212: 21.30159973117459
Sentence 44214: some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this.
Sentence 44217: actually they said he did sleep but so shortly  and fitfully that
Sentence 44219: 8.228058686047829
Sentence 44221: others admitted he was absolutely  correct- he never slept.
Sentence 44224: his body processes only slowed down enough  for him to dispell
Sentence 44226: 8.059409733643921
Sentence 44228: occasionally he fell into a  waking gritty-eyed stupor; but he
Sentence 44230: 6.480693448216934
Sentence 44232: naturally he couldn't let his shipmates know this.
Sentence 44235: insomnia  would ground him from the exploration service on
Sentence 44237: 6.527247349132692
Sentence 44239: he had to hide it.
Sentence 44240: 25.659219419391817

Sentence 44244: 6.973716106968502

Sentence 44249: since he couldn't  sleep anyway he might as well stand their

Sentence 44258: 6.965294609714713
Sentence 44260: ekstrohm had to hide his secret.
Sentence 44261: 9.670406878971576
Sentence 44263: in a camp instead of shipboard hiding the secret was easier.

Sentence 44348: why pick me for your patsy?  9.684323749366209
Sentence 44350: this has got to be some  kind of local phenomenon.
Sentence 44353: why accuse a shipmate of being behind this? 8.257640091759392
Sentence 44355: listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of  every
Sentence 44357: 10.143422291442931

Sentence 44388: 6.713926052561442

Sentence 44457: as she matured more and more  neural synapses would be adjusted
Sentence 44460: 7.331835168355716
Sentence 44462: for helva was  destined to be the brain half of a scout ship
Sentence 44466: she would be  among the elite of her kind.
Sentence 44467: 11.557104603852515
Sentence 44469: her initial intelligence tests registered  above normal and her
Sentence 44471: 6.183003451448296
Sentence 44473: as long  as her development within her shell lived up to
Sentence 44477: 6.340392602630257
Sentence 44479: however no diagram  of her brain patterns no early iq tests
Sentence 44482: 5.556304376121015

Sentence 44622: o i say the lady twittered.
Sentence 44623: 16.646095230094698
Sentence 44625: helva turned  her vision back to magnification and surveyed her

Sentence 49520: 6.6194456494230725

Sentence 49524: 7.615092762846159
Sentence 49526: she yanked away from him furiously.
Sentence 49527: 13.569464846992485
Sentence 49529: you shut up! shu-tt up-pp! i've got something to say to you and

Sentence 49533: do you hear me? 18.895468921462953
Sentence 49535: you're going to listen!  lord nodded agreeably.
Sentence 49536: 7.844415954402442
Sentence 49538: he said he wanted very much to listen.
Sentence 49539: 18.168535834383384
Sentence 49541: he knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say
Sentence 49544: 8.576781370730249
Sentence 49546: so would she mind speaking a little louder? 8.318581492070866
Sentence 49548: i think you stink tom lord! i think you're mean  and hateful
Sentence 49551: said joyce.

Sentence 49561: 13.671139498061125
Sentence 49563: he waited at the car side for a moment looking down  at her
Sentence 49565: 8.197648113411155
Sentence 49567: well?  19.804021762487697
Sentence 49569: wasn't you goin' to say  somethin'? 6.654449620674362
Sentence 49571: then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary  silence
Sentence 49574: print it in real big letters an' i can cipher it out later.
Sentence 49577: aah go on she said.
Sentence 49578: 11.568363037656766
Sentence 49580: just go the hell on.
Sentence 49581: 11.04184642448208
Sentence 49582: 12618.
Sentence 49583: he grinned  nodded and walked around to the front of the car.
Sentence 49586: lips pursed mournfully  he stared down at its crazily sagging
Sentence 49588: 6.002446559592496
Sentence 49590: then he hunkered  down on the heels of his handmade boots
Sentence 49594: he went prone on  his stomach the better to pursue his
Sentence 49596: 8.695854432244808
Sentence 49598: after a time he straightened  again brushing the red permian
Sentence 49601: 7.727222365517492
Sentence 49603: he wore no gun- a strange ommission for a peace officer  in
Sentence 49605: 7.583885718643907
Sentence 49607: never he'd once told joyce had he encountered  any man or
Sentence 49609: 7.826826025435942
Sentence 49611: and he really feels  that way she thought.
Sentence 49612: 11.449466057508422
Sentence 49614: that's really all he's got all he is.
Sentence 49615: 5.028623875776174
Sentence 49617: just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package.
Sentence 49620: if  i could make myself feel the same way h   she studied him
Sentence 49623: 6.530245932827497
Sentence 49625: here in the god-forsaken  place the westerly end of nowhere tom
Sentence 49627: 8.45647437626577
Sentence 49629: he was handsome with his coal-black  hair and eyes his fine-
Sentence 49631: 11.186713371780234
Sentence 49633: but she'd known plenty of handsomer guys and conceding his good
Sentence 49636: he wasn't a big man; rather on the medium side.
Sentence 49639: neither  was he very powerful of build.
Sentence 49640: 7.622507342753323
Sentence 49642: he could move very quickly she knew  but he was more wiry than
Sentence 49644: 9.833131466668718
Sentence 49646: and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an  almost
Sentence 49648: 7.641549371017116
Sentence 49650: just nothing she told herself.
Sentence 49651: 14.00840206751307
Sentence 49653: just so darned sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on
Sentence 49655: 6.6191958684901975
Sentence 49657: but by gosh i want him and i'm going to have him! he caught her eye
Sentence 49660: 8.243224909250143
Sentence 49662: why did these yokels still wear boots anyway when most had
Sentence 49665: he slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely
Sentence 49667: 6.757567981697296
Sentence 49669: oh cut it out tom! she snapped.
Sentence 49670: 8.196452441250985
Sentence 49672: can't  you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute?
Sentence 49675: this ain't your brand maybe lord suggested.
Sentence 49676: 7.14162538120728
Sentence 49678: or maybe  you just don't feel like a cigar? 9.846393082123427
Sentence 49680: i feel like getting  back to town that's what i feel like!
Sentence 49683: might get there faster  walkin' lord drawled seein' as how i
Sentence 49685: 7.555646014287481
Sentence 49687: on the other hand howsomever maybe you wouldn't either.

Sentence 49692: 9.125774742550359
Sentence 49694: how- with what? 12.292407525564322
Sentence 49695: 12650.
Sentence 49696: there's nothing out here but rattlesnakes.
Sentence 49697: 5.798444109528978
Sentence 49699: now ain't it the truth?  10.622662447258575
Sentence 49701: lord laughed with secret amusement.
Sentence 49702: 10.472119682746735
Sentence 49704: not a danged thing but rattlesnakes so i reckon i'll get  the
Sentence 49706: 6.630932335438428
Sentence 49708: tom! for god's sake! looky.
Sentence 49709: 11.568363037656766
Sentence 49711: he pointed cutting her off.
Sentence 49712: 17.048342700487726
Sentence 49714: see that wildcat?  15.594944937291627
Sentence 49716: she saw it then the distant derrick of the  wildcat- a test
Sentence 49718: 6.257697475937866
Sentence 49720: and even with her limited  knowledge of such things she knew that
Sentence 49723: 7.470712716675366
Sentence 49725: a wildcatter  had to be prepared for almost any emergency.
Sentence 49728: he had to depend on  himself since he was invariably miles and
Sentence 49730: 11.072524664532015
Sentence 49732: well let's get going she said impatiently.
Sentence 49733: 8.760798157016161
Sentence 49735: i-  she broke off frowning.
Sentence 49736: 11.568363037656766
Sentence 49738: what did you mean by that rattlesnake gag?  9.865657898260363
Sentence 49740: getting the boss rattlesnake to help you?  10.113770245223273
Sentence 49742: why  i meant what i said lord declared.
Sentence 49743: 7.14162538120728
Sentence 49745: what else would i mean  anyways?  14.705292966559352
Sentence 49747: she looked at him lips compressed.
Sentence 49748: 9.987973641461945
Sentence 49750: then with a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact
Sentence 49754: in his mood it was the best way to handle him; that is to show no
Sentence 49756: 9.644754093518667
Sentence 49758: otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum- teased and provoked
Sentence 49763: the car lurched along at a snail's crawl the left-front mudguard
Sentence 49766: 5.653570330727172
Sentence 49768: lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering  wheel.
Sentence 49771: he seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate
Sentence 49773: 7.554841062732162
Sentence 49775: along with this self-satisfaction however joyce sensed a growing
Sentence 49777: 12.670897604273614
Sentence 49779: it poured out of him like an electric current a feeling that the
Sentence 49782: 5.8388474235566274
Sentence 49784: joyce had seen him like  this once before- more than once
Sentence 49786: 7.794217276071636
Sentence 49788: that was the day that he had practically mopped  up the main
Sentence 49791: 6.420323994169083
Sentence 49793: tom had been laying  for aaron mcbride for a long time just
Sentence 49795: 8.81559499240046
Sentence 49797: mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with
Sentence 49799: 5.614905270311928
Sentence 49801: he had a legitimate reason for wearing it.
Sentence 49802: 15.783697866369657
Sentence 49804: it  was payday for highlands and he was packing a lot of money
Sentence 49806: 7.660682114954067
Sentence 49808: moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly the sheriff's
Sentence 49810: 8.897529244959287
Sentence 49812: so  what's this all about? 9.118533821976325
Sentence 49813: 12684.
Sentence 49814: he demanded when lord confronted him.
Sentence 49815: 13.671139498061125
Sentence 49817: i'm not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without
Sentence 49819: 5.554526260168297
Sentence 49821: it was the wrong thing to say.
Sentence 49822: 24.817817777269493
Sentence 49824: by failing to do  as he was told instantly- to take out a
Sentence 49828: the trouble was that he had virtually had to protest.
Sentence 49831: the deputy had forced him to  by his manner of accosting him.
Sentence 49834: so how about it?  15.777064725032243
Sentence 49836: he said.
Sentence 49837: 15.610129252044759
Sentence 49839: why single me out on this permit deal?  10.476177451418131
Sentence 49841: well  i'll tell you about that lord told him.
Sentence 49842: 7.025710106602091
Sentence 49844: we aim t' be see-lective  y'know?  15.292242212242115
Sentence 49846: don't like to bother no one unless we have to which i figger we
Sentence 49848: 3.531277043214802
Sentence 49850: figger we got to be plumb careful  with any of you highlands
Sentence 49852: 8.067600489792797
Sentence 49854: he himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company
Sentence 49856: 10.486068827214773
Sentence 49858: he was an honest man doing a hard  job and the implication that
Sentence 49860: 10.347934786823048
Sentence 49862: look lord he said hoarsely.
Sentence 49863: 12.50213707625067
Sentence 49865: i know you've got  a grudge against me and maybe i can't blame
Sentence 49867: 10.513599649718829
Sentence 49869: you think that highlands  swindled you and i helped 'em do it.
Sentence 49872: but you're all wrong man! i'm no lawyer.
Sentence 49873: 12.934994931595257
Sentence 49875: i just do what i'm told and- uh-huh.
Sentence 49876: 11.43943066874867
Sentence 49878: an' that could mean trouble with a fella that's  workin' for
Sentence 49880: 7.615092762846159
Sentence 49882: so you get rid of that pistol right now mis-ter  mcbride.
Sentence 49885: you do that or take you out a permit right now.
Sentence 49888: mcbride couldn't do either of course.
Sentence 49889: 7.622507342753323
Sentence 49891: not immediately as the  deputy demanded.
Sentence 49892: 14.174471042466617
Sentence 49894: not without a face-saving respite of at least a few  minutes.
Sentence 49897: to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible.
Sentence 49900: oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot.
Sentence 49901: 8.254441635698543
Sentence 49903: how could he exert authority over  them- make them toe the line
Sentence 49907: i'll get around to it a little  later he mumbled
Sentence 49909: 4.489674125097363
Sentence 49911: just as soon as i go to the bank and-   huh-uh.
Sentence 49914: now mis-ter mcbride said  lord and he laid a firmly restraining
Sentence 49916: 6.908404262125645
Sentence 49918: it was strictly the deputy's game but mcbride had gone too far to
Sentence 49920: 10.904928767278548
Sentence 49922: now he could only play the last card in what was probably the
Sentence 49924: 7.120582936368558
Sentence 49926: he flung off lord's  hand and attempted to push past him
Sentence 49928: 8.26265427207832
Sentence 49929: 12719.
Sentence 49930: it was practically the last move that mcbride made  of his own
Sentence 49932: 9.543590119202564
Sentence 49934: lord slugged him in the stomach so hard  that the organ almost
Sentence 49936: 8.305837855719702
Sentence 49938: then as he doubled  gasping vomiting the breakfast he had s o
Sentence 49940: 6.080245523647305
Sentence 49942: a rabbit punch redoubled him.
Sentence 49943: 13.150214475214955
Sentence 49945: and then  there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gut-
Sentence 49949: no  more could he defend himself against them.
Sentence 49950: 9.060328853487057
Sentence 49952: he seemed to be fighting  not one man but a dozen.
Sentence 49955: and he could no longer think of face-saving of honor but only of
Sentence 49957: 11.413301875505688
Sentence 49959: why he's going to kill me  he thought wildly.
Sentence 49960: 8.257640091759392
Sentence 49962: i meant him no harm.
Sentence 49963: 15.711603260075847
Sentence 49965: i've given willful hurt  to no man.
Sentence 49966: 4.7060581600896745
Sentence 49968: i was just doing my job just following orders and  for  that he's
Sentence 49970: 8.88233119648731
Sentence 49972: beat me to death in front of a hundred  people.
Sentence 49975: somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was  about to
Sentence 49976: the
Sentence 49978: 6.184916108314838
Sentence 49980: he mcbride would be cited  as in the wrong and he lord would go
Sentence 49983: 5.77232259685148
Sentence 49985: mcbride  staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the
Sentence 49987: 7.879513779734377
Sentence 49989: fear-maddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled
Sentence 49991: 5.825820622377272
Sentence 49993: he couldn't see; he was long past the point of  coherent
Sentence 49995: 8.120732436992942
Sentence 49997: dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but  he could not read
Sentence 49999: 5.542917982132687
Sentence 50001: he could not grasp that lord  had withdrawn from the fight
Sentence 50004: 8.016918159303074
Sentence 50006: he hated them too much to  understand- the people of this isolated
Sentence 50008: 7.95649079607987
Sentence 50010: this he was sure was the way they would  act;  laughing at a
Sentence 50012: 11.555938920427923
Sentence 50014: and nothing would be done about it.
Sentence 50015: 11.520289472815193
Sentence 50017: nothing unless h   donna!  donna his young wife the girl who was
Sentence 50019: 7.275524183453504

Sentence 50052: there was some idle talk a listless discussion of this or that
Sentence 50054: 7.935008882650276
Sentence 50056: but they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all
Sentence 50057: the failure  of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit.

Sentence 57397: 8.965436278742322

Sentence 57400: he heard none of these.

Sentence 57403: only the hum of insects and the distant  fluttering call of a

Sentence 57406: 14769.
Sentence 57407: because he couldn't hear them he was  more convinced they were

Sentence 57425: 8.257226076323082
Sentence 57427: the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound.
Sentence 57430: like a mischievous boy expecting punishment matsuo  awaited
Sentence 57432: 7.23987864060251

Sentence 57449: 6.643215071337043

Sentence 57511: 9.568768683299782

Sentence 57550: 11.295506928239226
Sentence 57552: too bad the marine had no water.
Sentence 57553: 9.955014462933434

Sentence 57586: 8.592800318346152
Sentence 57588: he sniffed and recognized it.
Sentence 57589: 15.385132030882776

Sentence 68195: 17677.
Sentence 68196: well- i didn't-  i didn't ever want to see that woman again.

Sentence 68205: maybe it's nothing maybe  it's intraepithelial or in situ- can't

Sentence 68222: we'd been standing  right outside miss bancroft's door and as i
Sentence 68225: 4.7939709498783944
Sentence 68227: but she seemed to be dozing and in any case we'd been talking in
Sentence 68229: 12.576625271489867
Sentence 68231: her eyes opened as soon as she heard me though  and once again i
Sentence 68233: 6.291850588050451
Sentence 68235: i sure can't complain about the service in this place she said.
Sentence 68238: i just got through seeing  one of you guys.
Sentence 68239: 10.41765113989062
Sentence 68241: what do you want?  32.209380504046656
Sentence 68243: there was something almost insulting in her tone but i
Sentence 68245: 10.74114804890189
Sentence 68247: i've just been talking to dr michelson i said.

Sentence 68251: 6.989227025969057
Sentence 68253: that's quite minor nothing to worry about.
Sentence 68254: 5.092274000697261
Sentence 68256: but we would like your permission to do- that is to go further if
Sentence 68258: 8.898445803840774
Sentence 68260: suppose you let me explain.
Sentence 68261: 12.793248192935202
Sentence 68263: actually i rather  doubt that we'll have to do this.
Sentence 68266: even if we do you'll be out  of here in a week probably.
Sentence 68269: i was sure that was the difficulty-  she just didn't want to stay
Sentence 68271: 7.003821224528446
Sentence 68273: i looked at her in amazement.
Sentence 68274: 16.398516126131685
Sentence 68276: i'd had patients who'd refused surgery before of course but never
Sentence 68280: mostly it was fear but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her
Sentence 68282: 6.643215071337043
Sentence 68284: will you tell me why? 11.371309518294675
Sentence 68286: i asked.
Sentence 68287: 15.594944937291627
Sentence 68289: she smiled a smile without humor.
Sentence 68290: 9.987973641461945
Sentence 68292: you shouldn't  tell your little secrets outside of the patient's
Sentence 68294: 11.773024459365168
Sentence 68296: i've got cancer haven't i? 4.830320705807231
Sentence 68298: she went on disregarding  my protests.
Sentence 68299: 14.140224473190667
Sentence 68301: i'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs.
Sentence 68304: let your pupils learn on someone else doctor.
Sentence 68307: just let me die in  peace.
Sentence 68308: 11.664678099686371
Sentence 68310: i stared at her almost speechless.
Sentence 68311: 13.93195501835056
Sentence 68313: her little  speech was totally out of character with the sort
Sentence 68315: 6.597743235151104
Sentence 68316: 17714.
Sentence 68317: even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone.
Sentence 68320: this was someone who'd come down in the world i thought.
Sentence 68323: a long  long way down.
Sentence 68324: 14.946256396843756
Sentence 68326: again there was something familiar about her something h   you
Sentence 68328: 5.438541781619698
Sentence 68330: i don't know what you heard that would make you  think so but i
Sentence 68334: and even if-   don't give me a lot  of talk joe.
Sentence 68337: she could have found out  my first name of course- that wouldn't
Sentence 68339: 9.289225517352772
Sentence 68341: but there was that something some echo in the way she spoke h
Sentence 68345: surprised baby? 19.804021762487697
Sentence 68347: guess i've changed haven't i?  8.254441635698543
Sentence 68349: but you haven't  changed much joe.
Sentence 68350: 20.041715074398393
Sentence 68352: i knew then knew with a heart-stopping  shock.
Sentence 68355: alice- i stammered through dry lips.
Sentence 68356: 9.670406878971576
Sentence 68358: alice  for goodness sake-   alice she echoed mockingly.
Sentence 68361: what's  the matter joe you scared of me?  9.060328853487057
Sentence 68363: think i'm going  to make you introduce a drunk as your wife?
Sentence 68366: well don't worry.
Sentence 68367: 18.126823107132473
Sentence 68369: just let me outta here-   but why did you come back?
Sentence 68372: i'd found my voice.
Sentence 68373: 11.568363037656766
Sentence 68375: where have you been all these years?  8.716510727165542
Sentence 68377: she shrugged.
Sentence 68378: 15.594944937291627
Sentence 68380: as for coming back here-  well i'll tell you the truth i didn't
Sentence 68382: 6.8027834073047115
Sentence 68384: the last thing i remember is a bar in san diego- the way she spoke
Sentence 68388: and this was gladdy's mother!   i  never asked you for any
Sentence 68390: 6.917644541082539
Sentence 68392: let me outta here! you doctors are all alike-  all you want is
Sentence 68395: no i want  out joe!   i looked at the pathetic wreck of a
Sentence 68397: 7.211471997118294
Sentence 68399: let her out let her out- that would be the solution wouldn't  it?
Sentence 68402: what she'd said was true- in all these years she'd  never asked
Sentence 68404: 6.374930091531647
Sentence 68406: if i let her go she'd disappear once more.
Sentence 68407: 14.783495810265471
Sentence 68409: and gladdy would be safe!  i was slowly swimming down to the
Sentence 68411: 9.447167606242754
Sentence 68413: her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman's;  the many
Sentence 68417: 5.9604142550402965
Sentence 68419: yielding-mediterranean-woman-flesh-of-water she soothed me and
Sentence 68421: 6.460370037324521
Sentence 68422: 17746.
Sentence 68423: i no longer knew how deep i was somewhere under 230 feet
Sentence 68427: the reasons  for this dive seemed foolish now.
Sentence 68428: 9.454794748865085
Sentence 68430: only the dive itself had any meaning.
Sentence 68431: 13.314912320072697
Sentence 68433: the metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove the
Sentence 68435: 6.374177419473055
Sentence 68437: perhaps if i took off the  aqua-lung i could swim better love my
Sentence 68439: 8.085051849983051
Sentence 68441: i chuckled aloud  and the mouthpiece fell out.
Sentence 68442: 9.95288923829895
Sentence 68444: while a hazy part of my mind  concentrated on swimming down a
Sentence 68447: 7.183378528152052
Sentence 68449: it was when i packed up what duds i had and went to paris.
Sentence 68452: it was no vacation just me getting out after a bellyfull.
Sentence 68455: i knew it wouldn't be the same.
Sentence 68456: 13.398514068525884
Sentence 68458: wild kicks never are but i hoped to dig up a better frame of mind.
Sentence 68461: once before i had been to paris long before i married valery.
Sentence 68464: that first time was good and it stuck with me.
Sentence 68467: i was twenty-one back then in the army and fog put our plane down
Sentence 68469: 7.6270957276481175
Sentence 68471: it was a saturday evening in april with a mist-like rain  and i
Sentence 68473: 10.862184975453024
Sentence 68475: i had a pocketful  of money which was unusual when i was in the
Sentence 68477: 8.58098053613431
Sentence 68479: in less than an hour i had gotten a  hotel showered shaved and
Sentence 68481: 8.82196709015072
Sentence 68483: i felt like a hun in rome.
Sentence 68484: 9.95288923829895
Sentence 68486: all the women were  beautiful  and the men were equal to them;
Sentence 68488: 8.960243031991713
Sentence 68490: there were some sweet machines other than women
Sentence 68493: 6.16382987370922
Sentence 68495: there was the arc  de triomphe and the tour d'eiffel- i was no
Sentence 68499: 7.906319556475118
Sentence 68501: i met claire which was better.
Sentence 68502: 10.981588546931944
Sentence 68504: she was  eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly
Sentence 68506: 7.5718671376870725
Sentence 68508: i didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful.
Sentence 68511: she was blonde and young and nice  and round in a tight white
Sentence 68513: 9.36901727689114
Sentence 68515: maybe her ravenous eating wasn't grotesque because she was so
Sentence 68517: 6.509287682983672
Sentence 68519: when she had  drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill
Sentence 68520: handsome soldier i have
Sentence 68522: 7.8286115926059665
Sentence 68524: i feel another of terrible urgency.

Sentence 68529: madame i said with noblesse oblige because  of the handsome-
Sentence 68531: 6.210871206873012
Sentence 68533: and so off we went  to her apartment.
Sentence 68534: 14.174557109683544
Sentence 68535: 17777.
Sentence 68536: she was a nymphomaniac of course the poor girl.
Sentence 68539: toward  the break of day i waxed philosophical and drew
Sentence 68541: 6.643215071337043
Sentence 68543: now it was nine years later  and it wasn't spring but winter
Sentence 68545: 7.113771001725556
Sentence 68547: i got  there on a saturday evening.
Sentence 68548: 13.93195501835056
Sentence 68550: i made the mistake of going to the jour  et nuit.
Sentence 68553: the place was busy but i didn't feel like a hun.
Sentence 68554: 9.607933015335522
Sentence 68556: i  sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up.
Sentence 68559: i had part of a bottle of french beer called panther pils then

Sentence 68575: all that day and monday i  drank just enough to orbit but not make
Sentence 68577: 6.812999093335208
Sentence 68579: i read the tropic  of capricorn and the tropic of cancer.
Sentence 68582: that's what was on my mind.
Sentence 68583: 4.3033852220845334
Sentence 68585: i was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when i dozed off.
Sentence 68588: i felt better tuesday evening  when i woke up.
Sentence 68589: 9.169644675936961
Sentence 68591: my head was clear my thinking sober and i was reconciled  to
Sentence 68593: 7.729850282319437
Sentence 68595: a good  binge has that kind of therapeutic value.
Sentence 68598: sometime earlier  the weather had turned cold and it was

Sentence 68602: i went out into it.
Sentence 68603: 12.384361145835424
Sentence 68605: i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a
Sentence 68608: 7.34935192810821

Sentence 68612: 9.002029935930091
Sentence 68614: i had on only a topcoat but i wasn't  cold.
Sentence 68615: 12.694378815185166
Sentence 68617: pretty soon a woman came along  carrying a folded umbrella as a
Sentence 68619: 5.746472650554231
Sentence 68621: she saw me and sat  down beside me three feet away.
Sentence 68624: suddenly i understood why she had  the umbrella.
Sentence 68627: it gave her poise and posture.
Sentence 68628: 16.49084636425047
Sentence 68630: without it she would have  been drab and limp.
Sentence 68631: 7.454173545246305
Sentence 68633: it gave her the right to sit down beside me back straight one hand
Sentence 68635: 9.451561199049534
Sentence 68637: i  couldn't imagine her without it.
Sentence 68638: 8.254441635698543

Sentence 68649: after a while she said with sort of an  unuttered laugh you
Sentence 68651: 7.321885100700919
Sentence 68653: hardly glancing at her i smiled a bleak  one which said thanks
Sentence 68655: 7.322457929711272
Sentence 68656: 17813.
Sentence 68657: she was silent for a while then said why are you so unhappy?
Sentence 68660: i'm not unhappy i lied staring at the snow.
Sentence 68661: 8.196044167676531
Sentence 68663: she was  trying to make a hole in my armor and i didn't want it.
Sentence 68666: is it a woman? 25.28301775737043
Sentence 68668: she asked gently.
Sentence 68669: 23.0547882925987
Sentence 68671: she must have seen the ring  on my left hand.
Sentence 68674: well- women and unhappiness go together  i observed profoundly
Sentence 68676: 5.427950274147271
Sentence 68678: ah monsieur it is not my business to wager it  h   this took me
Sentence 68680: 8.305979594899352
Sentence 68682: i felt my frozen sad face crumble and i grinned a silly one i
Sentence 68684: 6.5779768796623195
Sentence 68686: i even snorted a chuckle.
Sentence 68687: 15.711603260075847
Sentence 68689: she smiled at me but it  was an awfully sad smile.
Sentence 68692: she was even more miserable than me.

Sentence 68695: her eyes  were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness
Sentence 68697: 6.781245698092385
Sentence 68699: now isn't it better to smile?  12.13489043233157
Sentence 68701: she asked.
Sentence 68702: 19.287214484918096
Sentence 68704: because i liked this sad person so much i said will  you have a
Sentence 68707: i could see the ancient cynicism  reinforce itself in her eyes
Sentence 68711: anyway i pulled a bottle of  remy martin out of my topcoat
Sentence 68713: 6.82634608532905
Sentence 68715: i could see she was shocked.
Sentence 68716: 16.207843770215003
Sentence 68718: i'm sorry i haven't  got a glass i said.
Sentence 68719: 5.047630932330972
Sentence 68721: non non she said taking the  bottle not for that be sorry.
Sentence 68724: she tilted up and drank  and then i drank.

Sentence 68729: 3.0598239485149787
Sentence 68731: i wasn't going to lug around a  glass.
Sentence 68732: 10.5860574199871 55
Sentence 68734: there wasn't much light in the blue dark but i could  see her
Sentence 68736: 7.879734401926454
Sentence 68738: no child this tart she must have been thirty-five or  even forty.
Sentence 68741: somehow she was attractive.
Sentence 68742: 10.239544317116264
Sentence 68744: not good looking but self-confident and wise so that it made her
Sentence 68746: 9.472797605583995
Sentence 68748: i liked her and all at once i was glad she was there.
Sentence 68751: we  finished the bottle- i hadn't had a lot out of it earlier- not
Sentence 68753: 8.427997634276359
Sentence 68755: i suppose we were cold but we didn't feel it.
Sentence 68756: 8.555241096529764
Sentence 68758: we seemed to be drowsing sadly  soberly in the cold cold air
Sentence 68760: 11.493087317650293
Sentence 68762: then she said  allons and we got up and went to my hotel without
Sentence 68764: 7.234928804571701
Sentence 68766: i sensed no stranger in her.
Sentence 68767: 13.93195501835056
Sentence 68769: we undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance i had
Sentence 68771: 6.6981788258569415
Sentence 68773: i decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age.
Sentence 68775: 17849.
Sentence 68776: she had a funny little  scar on her stomach on the left side.
Sentence 68779: i think we were very tired for we awoke at the same moment deeply
Sentence 68782: 8.281994663586115
Sentence 68784: i felt wonderful the absolute opposite of last night's melancholy.
Sentence 68787: i was hungry as a wolf and my body felt lean and vital.
Sentence 68790: bon jour i said brightly  sitting up which pulled the covers to
Sentence 68792: 5.674295354649883
Sentence 68794: she looked good with her short tousled hair and no make-up.
Sentence 68797: maybe closer to thirty i  thought.
Sentence 68798: 10.053899942483259
Sentence 68800: bon jour! she exclaimed smiling.
Sentence 68801: 10.472119682746735
Sentence 68803: j'ai faim! yeah but breakfast first.

Sentence 68827: she asked innocently.
Sentence 68828: 23.0547882925987

Sentence 69371: you can't keep that kind of information quiet  in a town of only
Sentence 69373: 5.929618084281545
Sentence 69375: and i've been told that just about  every town no matter what
Sentence 69377: 8.35296314010345
Sentence 69379: just as it has its susan dolan though nobody'd ever bothered to
Sentence 69381: 9.533515582452859
Sentence 69383: they even talked about  lucille down at the young christians'

Sentence 69388: i never heard my folks talk about her though.
Sentence 69389: 9.821732468923537
Sentence 69391: they were good-living religious people and i can truthfully say
Sentence 69395: even if they ever  did say anything about people like lucille
Sentence 69399: my folks and my faith protected me from things like that.
Sentence 69402: and so i was really upset  the first time i discovered that my boy
Sentence 69404: 7.677297265180811
Sentence 69405: 18016.
Sentence 69406: i asked him about it one night while we were sitting  in his

Sentence 69416: look sue baby he'd said.
Sentence 69417: 12.50213707625067
Sentence 69419: much as i love you- well a guy's a guy and lucille's willing to-
Sentence 69421: 8.22122337004559
Sentence 69423: honest kitten that's all it is- i don't even  like lucille
Sentence 69425: 6.002446559592496
Sentence 69427: i guess it was at that moment that i  realized what i was up
Sentence 69429: 9.065006481749224
Sentence 69431: but it didn't seem fair.
Sentence 69432: 11.59959732049716

Sentence 69447: i wasn't in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men but the
Sentence 69449: 5.500198106370456
Sentence 69451: he wasn't only different- he was it.
Sentence 69452: 12.411802052220429
Sentence 69454: he had an easy masculine grace about him the kind that kids don't
Sentence 69458: his smile was quick  and his eyes held some promised secret that
Sentence 69460: 7.242188230830913
Sentence 69462: the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he
Sentence 69464: 7.888376441049139
Sentence 69466: i could hardly believe such  good luck was mine.
Sentence 69469: and now lucille warren had gotten a look  at him.
Sentence 69472: i guess she was between affairs or something but anyway she had
Sentence 69474: 7.721756160345477
Sentence 69476: i didn't  like it one bit.
Sentence 69477: 12.384361145835424
Sentence 69479: but what could i do? 22.454724570423792
Sentence 69481: a man had to have his release- at least that's what the boys
Sentence 69485: she wouldn't have even if he'd asked her.
Sentence 69486: 9.060328853487057
Sentence 69488: but he wouldn't ask her- he wasn't the kind of man who would force
Sentence 69490: 6.969289670820706
Sentence 69492: and he wouldn't leave her either- he'd  told me that.
Sentence 69495: he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and  leave those
Sentence 69497: 7.218323960599 85
Sentence 69499: johnnie  loved me and wanted me.
Sentence 69500: 10.472119682746735
Sentence 69502: but the only love i was giving him was the  pure kind.
Sentence 69505: it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time.
Sentence 69508: against my folks'  wishes we'd been seeing each other for short
Sentence 69510: 6.335090789657119
Sentence 69512: the rides were tame enough- mostly we talked.
Sentence 69515: but by the time the  first crackling of spring came around we both
Sentence 69517: 8.517624550477853
Sentence 69518: 18048.
Sentence 69519: yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck  a
Sentence 69521: 9.81594016844098
Sentence 69523: it's so crazy i told him once.
Sentence 69524: 3.574989767277945
Sentence 69526: i always  imagined i would probably end up marrying a minister or
Sentence 69528: 8.923469128060672
Sentence 69530: and you  fall for a lumber jockey.
Sentence 69531: 10.242612813271945
Sentence 69533: who drinks far too much.
Sentence 69534: 13.914630479694948
Sentence 69536: and i was ticking off the items on my fingers swears too much and
Sentence 69540: 5.482104079398595
Sentence 69542: he examined his nails carefully.
Sentence 69543: 15.385132030882776
Sentence 69545: i could walk  out the door.
Sentence 69546: 15.08379379512986
Sentence 69548: and never show my face or my truck around here again.
Sentence 69551: he still wasn't looking  at me.
Sentence 69552: 12.99784219403056

Sentence 69558: 16.99478977991575
Sentence 69560: and now he was seeing her.
Sentence 69561: 10.73634014612502
Sentence 69563: he'd just admitted it to me.
Sentence 69564: 7.622507342753323
Sentence 69566: i huddled miserably beside him in the truck.
Sentence 69569: it was all my doing- his  seeing her.
Sentence 69570: 16.01311191492744
Sentence 69572: johnnie and i had been innocent in our love and that was  the
Sentence 69574: 7.359786578411542
Sentence 69576: at first johnnie hadn't understood-  how could he not being a
Sentence 69579: but then he had said all right kid if that's how you want it
Sentence 69581: 8.80918415531882
Sentence 69583: but what had i done trying to keep us pure? 10.133091185569643
Sentence 69585: i had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman.
Sentence 69588: i had just  the same as delivered him into the hands of the

Sentence 69593: i was desperate to hold him to give him whatever in this world he
Sentence 69597: and though at the time i blushed to admit it even to myself there
Sentence 69602: i wanted him with a terrifying fierceness.
Sentence 69603: 14.614236527667497
Sentence 69605: astonishingly enough it was my own voice i heard there in the

Sentence 69615: uh huh.
Sentence 69616: 15.594944937291627
Sentence 69618: and i snuggled closer to the man l loved.
Sentence 69619: 14.140453682961244
Sentence 69621: it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever
Sentence 69623: 11.455245618923785
Sentence 69625: i had had no wedding ceremony no witnesses no certificate of
Sentence 69629: johnnie h?  19.804021762487697
Sentence 69631: it can't be wrong can it?  12.998584141589314
Sentence 69633: not really.
Sentence 69634: 24.557957404011628
Sentence 69636: johnnie rose on one elbow.
Sentence 69637: 8.254441635698543
Sentence 69639: it's never wrong  if love is real.
Sentence 69640: 3.7110521007927275
Sentence 69641: 18085.
Sentence 69642: i took great comfort from his words  and smiled to myself in the
Sentence 69644: 7.033748404049442
Sentence 69646: idiot's delight i later discovered.
Sentence 69647: 10.472119682746735
Sentence 69649: i felt no conflict  between what i was doing and my strict
Sentence 69651: 7.033748404049442
Sentence 69653: i had  always resisted the passes made at me by other kids and
Sentence 69657: 6.226393231944687
Sentence 69659: i had also thought a lot about how god must look on true love and
Sentence 69662: 5.715313143521816
Sentence 69664: i was practically a bride after all.
Sentence 69665: 14.894590857967684
Sentence 69667: there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible.
Sentence 69670: of this i had no doubt.
Sentence 69671: 19.233308868905468
Sentence 69673: wouldn't johnnie do practically anything  in the world to insure
Sentence 69676: of course he would.
Sentence 69677: 26.85286408234465
Sentence 69679: he'd not only told me so he'd proved it.
Sentence 69680: 6.764147616291221
Sentence 69682: it wasn't johnnie's fault  that he was hopelessly tied down to
Sentence 69686: just because he was honorable  enough to want to continue
Sentence 69691: and if i could contribute to that i'd do it.
Sentence 69692: 14.67317734953822
Sentence 69694: no price is too high when true love is at stake.
Sentence 69695: 6.985638126001336
Sentence 69697: and i had no doubts about how true this love was.
Sentence 69700: i'd never even petted with a boy and after i met johnnie he never
Sentence 69703: 4.6904158433825796
Sentence 69705: he was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman
Sentence 69708: 7.403356913574332
Sentence 69710: what could a mere twelve years matter?  10.221825396187453
Sentence 69712: it wasn't i was sure a difference in age that came between
Sentence 69714: 8.023901015885288
Sentence 69716: and hadn't i rescued him from  lucille warren?  9.342113951872065
Sentence 69718: she'd have gotten him if i hadn't stopped  her.
Sentence 69719: 8.581436094141479
Sentence 69721: after all lucille warren was a husband-stealer from way  back.
Sentence 69724: but i'd been a good girl and now god was blessing me with the gift
Sentence 69728: it was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might
Sentence 69730: 9.996759250554351
Sentence 69732: always and always johnnie? 11.952165518888542

Sentence 69746: 8.322840996590806
Sentence 69748: i had mixed emotions about going.
Sentence 69749: 13.461924932958663
Sentence 69751: i'd been  seeing johnnie almost a year now but i still didn't want
Sentence 69753: 5.8493448928655996
Sentence 69754: 18117.
Sentence 69755: but i had looked forward so much to being  with this church
Sentence 69757: 8.701500906341561
Sentence 69759: i hadn't been doing as much work as i used  to in westfield and i
Sentence 69763: i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this  fine
Sentence 69765: 7.80233911057633
Sentence 69767: so i went to boston.

Sentence 69785: 10.418435513015963
Sentence 69787: i thought so and he mentioned it and alma said  so too.
Sentence 69790: after the meeting there was going to be a party at  someone's
Sentence 69792: 14.752858607261347
Sentence 69794: i assumed alma would get me there but in the confusion of the

Sentence 69798: outside the hall  i anxiously looked around for her then all at
Sentence 69800: 7.720575835317753
Sentence 69802: hey there beautiful twin of mine ronald  said.
Sentence 69803: 7.14162538120728

Sentence 69807: i couldn't  help laughing with him.
Sentence 69808: 12.384361145835424
Sentence 69810: well i should find alma-  i began.
Sentence 69811: 12.107821717729271
Sentence 69813: by the time we arrived the party was already going strong.
Sentence 69816: a couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and i realized

Sentence 69820: my folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house so my first
Sentence 69822: 5.279310736414392
Sentence 69824: i hadn't liked it at first- it was bitter and burning.
Sentence 69827: but when  johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale i enjoyed
Sentence 69829: 7.793238909001978
Sentence 69831: of course i enjoyed 'most anything if i did it with johnnie.
Sentence 69834: johnnie  h i suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my
Sentence 69836: 5.898161823557716
Sentence 69838: but that was only natural i decided; surely he was still resting
Sentence 69840: 10.699589952780414
Sentence 69842: i don't see alma anywhere  i said.
Sentence 69843: 5.514786625900389
Sentence 69845: c'mon let's find  out where they're keeping the glasses.
Sentence 69848: i-  i don't think so ronald.

Sentence 69851: aw come on.
Sentence 69852: 15.594944937291627

Sentence 69857: strange faces most of them and i wasn't even sure all of them had
Sentence 69859: 9.94001133804793
Sentence 69861: under normal circumstances he had a certain bright-eyed all-
Sentence 69864: 6.300230992619183
Sentence 69866: today he looked like an astronaut who had left his vitamin pills
Sentence 69867: hollow eyes hollow cheeks
Sentence 69869: 6.896888396467524
Sentence 69870: 18149.

Sentence 69874: he looked around his little eden
Sentence 69876: 9.592132658614503
Sentence 69878: you share a refrigerator mrs kirby had said and somehow  at
Sentence 69881: 6.621185110768666
Sentence 69883: in the cold light of day it seemed a lunatic  arrangement.
Sentence 69886: share bath maybe- but share refrigerator?  7.622507342753323
Sentence 69888: she had explained it- something about summer people's eating out
Sentence 69890: 7.2628435485607765
Sentence 69892: and where was the thing?  12.693774132123336
Sentence 69894: he remembered seeing it last night when he put away his small
Sentence 69896: 8.52351370118872
Sentence 69898: ah yes- his half of a refrigerator stood outside on the curving
Sentence 69900: 5.272292847138255
Sentence 69902: it was still raining and mrs kirby's cottages  bloomed through
Sentence 69906: charlie downed his orange juice and one of  the long skinny green
Sentence 69908: 5.083242045036259
Sentence 69910: this vacation had seemed like a good idea last week when his doctor
Sentence 69912: 8.59443225167528
Sentence 69914: take a full month the doctor had said.
Sentence 69915: 8.403407694771781
Sentence 69917: lots of sun lots of rest.
Sentence 69918: 10.472119682746735
Sentence 69920: the red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound.
Sentence 69921: 8.976097203071156
Sentence 69923: this is a sleeping capsule.
Sentence 69924: 27.555925243887035
Sentence 69926: the others will make you a little more  comfortable until you
Sentence 69928: 7.2135768416778685

Sentence 69933: charlie had accepted the  diagnosis without comment.
Sentence 69936: the doctor could call it anything from flu  to beriberi; but

Sentence 69941: he had loved and lost vivian  wayne to somebody else had
Sentence 69946: he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed  distrust of
Sentence 69948: 11.16988868306799
Sentence 69950: once burned- scalded really because vivian  had given him every
Sentence 69952: 6.919108887321692
Sentence 69954: from now on  his was going to be a man's world
Sentence 69958: meanwhile he  had this miserable cold and as he leaned against
Sentence 69963: in these damp circumstances  he was an odds-on bet to develop
Sentence 69965: 10.715374875612495
Sentence 69967: he looked up to see mrs kirby awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-
Sentence 69969: 6.884446573441091
Sentence 69971: three-day blow! she bellowed  triumphantly.
Sentence 69973: 18177.
Sentence 69974: he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard
Sentence 69977: 8.331783887545436
Sentence 69979: fine day after tomorrow she added.

Sentence 69982: i hope so he said.
Sentence 69983: 16.05383250239435
Sentence 69985: thought i'd bake it out in the sun.
Sentence 69986: 9.060328853487057
Sentence 69988: you've got  a peaked look.
Sentence 69989: 5.539895886183769
Sentence 69991: better get in out of the wet.
Sentence 69992: 14.077825454787035
Sentence 69994: charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal
Sentence 69996: 5.674295354649883
Sentence 69998: as for its being fine day after tomorrow he had  the unhappy
Sentence 70001: 8.263875900162324
Sentence 70003: he could imagine her at this minute honeymooning in nassau with
Sentence 70006: 6.012784696310228
Sentence 70008: all charlie could look forward  to was a yellow pill at noon a
Sentence 70012: he leafed through the light reading provided by mrs kirby for her
Sentence 70013: four separate adventures of the bobbsey twins  and several
Sentence 70016: 5.55391438101163
Sentence 70018: he dozed only to dream of vivian and woke only to crash into the
Sentence 70020: 7.496552459822804
Sentence 70022: he took a yellow  pill only to choke on it and went for the
Sentence 70025: 6.128050522925441
Sentence 70027: his first thought was that mrs kirby in her mania for color had
Sentence 70033: 5.9852718261802
Sentence 70035: he  thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable
Sentence 70039: 5.315205345526763
Sentence 70041: next morning he found a note in the refrigerator.
Sentence 70042: 9.533518726891069
Sentence 70044: would you mind wrapping your onion?  11.004706853480066
Sentence 70046: said this note.
Sentence 70047: 17.7108913990712
Sentence 70049: the smell permeates  everything! everything being the sweater a
Sentence 70053: the note paper was pink too and the handwriting small and dainty
Sentence 70055: 8.086542342015262
Sentence 70057: not that he had supposed considering the evidence that he was
Sentence 70061: he scrawled  sorry across the bottom of the note and then
Sentence 70062: don't you eat?  9.823480406145869
Sentence 70064: he didn't want to encourage anything here; but on the other hand
Sentence 70066: 6.389099735105381
Sentence 70068: not onions came the answer the  following day.
Sentence 70069: 13.16572876288734
Sentence 70071: must have really smelled up her sweater he thought and wondered
Sentence 70073: 5.549619948983278
Sentence 70075: but then as he well knew women are not guided by logic or common
Sentence 70077: 9.476937300310858
Sentence 70078: 18203.
Sentence 70079: now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure
Sentence 70082: 5.816465357739164
Sentence 70084: they would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid chic  and
Sentence 70086: 11.163681756638251
Sentence 70088: pink vivian once had told him  was for baby girls and grown-up
Sentence 70092: why does this girl keep a sweater  in the refrigerator?
Sentence 70095: he mused aloud.
Sentence 70096: 16.99478977991575
Sentence 70098: eh? 19.804021762487697
Sentence 70100: it was  mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda
Sentence 70104: what's that  you say? 9.488114765205632
Sentence 70106: oh nothing.
Sentence 70107: 15.82425196957161
Sentence 70109: just glad the rain's stopped.
Sentence 70110: 14.00840206751307
Sentence 70112: just look at that sky.
Sentence 70113: 11.04184642448208
Sentence 70115: be a scorcher by afternoon.
Sentence 70116: 16.469374782788545
Sentence 70118: i've got this cold.
Sentence 70119: 4.990273077554887
Sentence 70121: she scrutinized him.
Sentence 70122: 19.344067135409958
Sentence 70124: you want  to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash first
Sentence 70126: 6.838755953429809
Sentence 70128: i must remember to warn the girl next to you in larkspur.
Sentence 70131: that pale kind's the worst.
Sentence 70132: 13.51881576711259
Sentence 70134: that pale kind charlie thought.
Sentence 70135: 14.860954966088402
Sentence 70137: but then neither was peaked.
Sentence 70138: 14.99177374306145
Sentence 70140: he could  hear mrs kirby now warning her pale guest against
Sentence 70142: 9.592132658614503
Sentence 70144: i  spoke to the fellow next door too she might say.
Sentence 70147: surely there was a better word.
Sentence 70148: 12.553033618835462
Sentence 70150: charlie looked in the mirror.
Sentence 70151: 9.118533821976325
Sentence 70153: frail  feeble- peaked.
Sentence 70154: 15.594944937291627
Sentence 70156: clearly two damp days with the bobbsey twins  had done him no
Sentence 70158: 6.261864188559015
Sentence 70160: the sun blazing hot as prophesied was far from kind to mrs kirby's
Sentence 70162: 8.750840608424541
Sentence 70164: when charlie  came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill
Sentence 70168: 5.216441306835459
Sentence 70170: this weekend he thought he would look around for some more subdued
Sentence 70172: 7.636206967030689
Sentence 70174: he could not imagine a flower's being brave enough to grow beside
Sentence 70176: 7.8967518591202825
Sentence 70178: the sweater was gone from the refrigerator and in its place was a
Sentence 70180: 7.068970569960655
Sentence 70182: no wonder she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes.
Sentence 70185: he got a  red pill and a beer and then on impulse transferred the
Sentence 70188: 8.676470920683538
Sentence 70190: it gave him a good feeling.
Sentence 70191: 14.040554417444826
Sentence 70193: thanks  was her answer the next day.
Sentence 70194: 9.670406878971576
Sentence 70196: the note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a
Sentence 70197: you're not at all well are you?  7.0519299194784555
Sentence 70199: i've got this cold he wrote.
Sentence 70200: 5.970410411927927
Sentence 70201: 18239.
Sentence 70202: not that it  was any of her business.
Sentence 70203: 10.960533574133022
Sentence 70205: it's none of my business said  the next note but my aunt elsie
Sentence 70208: 4.453758789440153
Sentence 70210: i mean  she's still living and she's ninety-six.
Sentence 70213: why don't you try that?  13.663388853342104
Sentence 70215: i don't have a lemon.

Sentence 72269: 15.93329064165616
Sentence 72271: he never will cady.
Sentence 72272: 15.068059069186956
Sentence 72274: not the kind of leadership you mean working with lots of people.
Sentence 72277: all your wishful thinking won't change  that.
Sentence 72278: 9.785091048588368
Sentence 72280: remember what you used to say in the army?  13.017283327234006
Sentence 72282: you can't run a war with ninety-nine generals and one private!
Sentence 72285: 4.961624055085771
Sentence 72287: martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist
Sentence 72289: 8.571850877310746
Sentence 72291: and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions.
Sentence 72294: the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life.
Sentence 72297: lying awake  at night he could see them laid out on the floor
Sentence 72299: 8.836201299035759
Sentence 72301: when he rose in the morning the image was still there.
Sentence 72304: he had always  been a messy and negligent man.
Sentence 72307: in his bachelor days his bedroom had been strewn with clothes
Sentence 72310: 8.164433496401529
Sentence 72312: no doubt dolores resented following  in their footsteps.
Sentence 72315: but it was fun those first days kidding  about the trail of
Sentence 72317: 10.470414911750577
Sentence 72319: there  was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to
Sentence 72321: 6.573725984468509
Sentence 72323: half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things.
Sentence 72326: he  remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room
Sentence 72328: 7.340211557527661
Sentence 72330: the smooth curve of her neck very white against hair which curled
Sentence 72332: 7.860799503526907
Sentence 72333: 18843.
Sentence 72334: her hair was the color of those blooms which  in seed
Sentence 72340: 4.7900141444425755
Sentence 72342: so he sought her out and spoke  to her and thought of his hand in
Sentence 72344: 8.946285369641288
Sentence 72346: or against her back  pressed on the column of vertebrae which held
Sentence 72351: but to put it  bluntly nothing snapped.
Sentence 72352: 17.61249236409776
Sentence 72354: yet that had not seriously troubled him  not then.
Sentence 72357: more he could take at leisure.
Sentence 72358: 12.89760508101065
Sentence 72360: all martin  thought he needed was time
Sentence 72363: he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly.
Sentence 72366: there  was too little occasion beforehand for resistance the
Sentence 72370: they had left themselves  too much to discover.
Sentence 72371: 14.46825350295397
Sentence 72373: but at the start his new life felt invigorating.
Sentence 72376: it was on the tenth day after the wedding  that he dropped the
Sentence 72378: 13.250261829637637
Sentence 72380: now i'm not going to pick up those shorts!  martin gave her a
Sentence 72382: 8.721623440704747
Sentence 72384: i think you'll get tired of  them there.
Sentence 72385: 16.790687606295677
Sentence 72387: in the morning the shorts were where he had left them.
Sentence 72390: he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till
Sentence 72392: 10.891839559707224
Sentence 72394: it was almost too easy.
Sentence 72395: 21.83093509210906
Sentence 72397: for he had just remembered
Sentence 72399: 12.669651730336986
Sentence 72401: the shorts would not be  on the floor when he came home that
Sentence 72403: 7.342113974448288
Sentence 72405: the rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness
Sentence 72409: they gave the room  a strange note of incongruity like a mole on
Sentence 72411: 6.376876511860498
Sentence 72413: he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute
Sentence 72415: 12.613855219284895
Sentence 72417: quietly he determined to foil her.
Sentence 72418: 7.622507342753323
Sentence 72420: i can  be as stubborn as she can he thought; my nerves are as
Sentence 72422: 8.613473101510026
Sentence 72424: she'll  rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings.
Sentence 72427: martin was standing a few feet from the front  door.
Sentence 72430: he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet  away.
Sentence 72433: dolores stood motionless in the doorway.
Sentence 72434: 9.670406878971576
Sentence 72436: he could not cross  the living room brush past her and bend down
Sentence 72438: 7.605285587081398
Sentence 72440: he strode to answer the bell.
Sentence 72441: 16.253461520996265
Sentence 72442: 18873.
Sentence 72443: bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet.
Sentence 72444: 8.108225911312923
Sentence 72446: with the most casual and relaxed manner in the world dolores led
Sentence 72448: 11.760221489068845
Sentence 72450: at first he could not be sure.
Sentence 72451: 15.714104903279903
Sentence 72453: then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still
Sentence 72455: 11.648855077952735
Sentence 72457: a glissade of giggles slid over their voices.
Sentence 72458: 8.023923068000494
Sentence 72460: all evening anthea  favored him with odd coy looks.
Sentence 72463: clearly she had been instructed not to say a word.
Sentence 72466: for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it
Sentence 72468: 8.845748025528591
Sentence 72470: at last there  was a void no one could fill.
Sentence 72471: 9.72700310275711
Sentence 72473: the brainards went home early.
Sentence 72474: 13.848082117783294
Sentence 72476: martin realized later on that he should have had it out with
Sentence 72478: 6.157782125570901
Sentence 72480: but he was so taken  aback he could not believe any rage of his
Sentence 72482: 11.399306113189299
Sentence 72484: on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fumed
Sentence 72486: 7.824183542320377
Sentence 72488: and if he surrendered after raving  at her.
Sentence 72491: suppose he ran up the white flag altogether?  9.213166806925662
Sentence 72493: at once.
Sentence 72494: 15.594944937291627
Sentence 72496: he considered the sober possibility.
Sentence 72497: 12.127026643485452
Sentence 72499: in  his head was the echo of those titters with anthea.
Sentence 72502: there was something about private feminine whisperings which
Sentence 72504: 7.976318551181658
Sentence 72506: he remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women
Sentence 72510: 7.663492800193362
Sentence 72512: he could even recall the last time he sat there.
Sentence 72513: 0.0
Sentence 72515: she was talking about him that time because he had done some bad
Sentence 72519: he apologized so sweetly i couldn't keep being annoyed with him.
Sentence 72522: it wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time;  he
Sentence 72525: 7.24553549919109
Sentence 72527: but his mother told the  story over and over till her martin
Sentence 72530: 7.413482343312619
Sentence 72532: the battle had to be fought.
Sentence 72533: 13.589290166239456
Sentence 72535: let the best sex win.
Sentence 72536: 16.938059354978364
Sentence 72538: but his resolution  hardly seemed to help.
Sentence 72539: 16.249673089949898
Sentence 72541: if the situation had been bad it now got  worse.
Sentence 72544: about this time people began dropping in considering  that the
Sentence 72546: 8.017514092899379
Sentence 72548: angrily martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a
Sentence 72551: 4.914571349332856
Sentence 72553: here they were at the mercy of anyone who  chose to come by.
Sentence 72556: these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores  showing
Sentence 72558: 6.487410277193333
Sentence 72559: 18906.
Sentence 72560: of course the tours of inspection  included the ever-present
Sentence 72562: 14.646678723792014
Sentence 72564: it was curious how the  different visitors took this.
Sentence 72567: some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's  countenance.
Sentence 72570: to them  all dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale.
Sentence 72573: it's a little  contest martin and i have she would begin gaily
Sentence 72577: while he waited in the living room.
Sentence 72578: 11.770135364812466
Sentence 72580: they entered the  bedroom and dolores said nothing.
Sentence 72583: then one of the guests showed his  merriment.
Sentence 72584: 12.97449611012744
Sentence 72586: you were in a hurry weren't you? 14.61704916710057
Sentence 72588: martin would  have liked to break the man's neck.
Sentence 72591: dolores smiled; she let the  interpretation stand.
Sentence 72594: now martin heard himself give a snort of mock  good nature.
Sentence 72597: with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth ready to begin
Sentence 72600: 6.75962265097091
Sentence 72602: they kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations.
Sentence 72605: but martin seldom felt the impulse  to talk about anything.
Sentence 72608: what to talk about?  19.946752732958277
Sentence 72610: dolores kept picking up any of his clothes which he left  about
Sentence 72614: he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and
Sentence 72618: in his moments of worst agony martin  imagined what his friends
Sentence 72620: 10.301689440447241
Sentence 72622: the sound of their amazement.
Sentence 72623: 15.82973940139538
Sentence 72625: bizarre
Sentence 72626: 9.670406878971576
Sentence 72628: we were up to visit them and h   he had thought her exactly what
Sentence 72630: 6.939400130024042
Sentence 72632: six weeks of marriage and i'm using the past tense  he told
Sentence 72634: 8.352018501672953
Sentence 72636: pursuing his idea he saw that it would  be impossible to leave
Sentence 72638: 5.725106139771221
Sentence 72640: everyone would know why; he would  cut a supremely ridiculous
Sentence 72642: 8.588365263176025
Sentence 72644: day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he
Sentence 72646: 5.427950274147271
Sentence 72648: his mind scurried frantically seeking an exit.
Sentence 72651: alternately  he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he
Sentence 72655: nothing would  change nothing would ever change.
Sentence 72656: 11.20966096597004
Sentence 72658: when the solution finally  came to him one night while he was in
Sentence 72661: 7.581357291985703
Sentence 72662: 18936.
Sentence 72663: in a frenzy of excitement he considered his plan.
Sentence 72666: beside his shorts he would place something of hers.
Sentence 72669: instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory
Sentence 72673: 5.944299494118182
Sentence 72675: he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to
Sentence 72679: furthermore  he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly
Sentence 72682: 5.867756097854561
Sentence 72684: sooner or later dolores would crack.
Sentence 72685: 8.842581037245965
Sentence 72687: on the  other hand if she didn't remove her own things it would
Sentence 72690: 8.422244438181218
Sentence 72692: martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the
Sentence 72694: 6.3591809137220165
Sentence 72696: the tale he thought would become less gay.
Sentence 72697: 11.387658710676023
Sentence 72699: she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his
Sentence 72703: 5.1228410389078745
Sentence 72705: to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor  would draw
Sentence 72707: 8.319279986639128
Sentence 72709: something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence
Sentence 72713: 5.83470013917517
Sentence 72715: the knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death  and
Sentence 72718: 7.614116552419703
Sentence 72720: the next morning while dolores was out of  the room he went to
Sentence 72723: 6.013299531219403
Sentence 72725: he sat down on the bed.
Sentence 72726: 15.960151928300284
Sentence 72728: in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared.
Sentence 72731: to  his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two garments.
Sentence 72734: slowly and  deliberately she reached down and touched the lace
Sentence 72738: ah he thought she's going through  the chain of reasoning which
Sentence 72742: he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the  implications of a
Sentence 72744: 7.084635849180763
Sentence 72746: extending her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and
Sentence 72748: 7.198778874655976
Sentence 72750: she did not look at him but he noticed that her face  was flushed
Sentence 72752: 6.481903503096435
Sentence 72754: they breakfasted together  but martin did not refer to his triumph
Sentence 72757: 8.538074191159637
Sentence 72759: well martin thought that'll save.
Sentence 72760: 10.59633742259972
Sentence 72762: he left  for work in high spirits.
Sentence 72763: 13.671139498061125
Sentence 72764: 18961.
Sentence 72765: as he relaxed that day martin realized  how tense he had been
Sentence 72767: 8.155228827261835
Sentence 72769: he found that he no longer hated dolores and he was  surprised
Sentence 72771: 8.151949504457676

Sentence 72781: 7.989411253772792
Sentence 72783: isn't his racket down your alley? 6.367299372027611
Sentence 72785: once it was william thought.
Sentence 72786: 11.2066383623343

Sentence 72791: how did he start on such a ride to brief glory?  8.992337125359954

Sentence 72821: 4.8499587422515935
Sentence 72823: probably mr willis was influenced  toward deeper involvement by
Sentence 72827: gerry began to aid freddy with her father prodded no doubt by
Sentence 72831: another factor must have been the eventual disposal  of willis'
Sentence 72836: whatever the reasons willis and bryan started expanding zenith.

Sentence 75811: 16.175384724461775
Sentence 75813: not the least bit arlene snapped.

Sentence 75829: but not hard for very long.
Sentence 75830: 13.32087353114638
Sentence 75832: just long enough to make you feel important.

Sentence 75838: 5.090976854877514
Sentence 75840: now we're going to be like what general burnside and his horse
Sentence 75842: 8.224938264294419
Sentence 75844: the children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down
Sentence 75846: 8.554703210972606
Sentence 75848: their curiosity went happily out of bounds.
Sentence 75849: 10.783667833983843
Sentence 75851: then arlene threw herself  backwards and wiggled in a way that was
Sentence 75853: 8.105399995998898
Sentence 75854: 19732.
Sentence 75855: she held herself  that way and turned her head towards them and
Sentence 75857: 8.347995902467632
Sentence 75859: imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part
Sentence 75861: 6.203069029352619

Sentence 75871: she made general  burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it
Sentence 75873: 9.676512795569494
Sentence 75875: then she was back on her feet winking and smiling that enormous
Sentence 75877: 7.635793100687079
Sentence 75879: and she would wink and throw  kisses.
Sentence 75880: 15.52982985573769
Sentence 75882: they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time but
Sentence 75884: 6.844846080714984
Sentence 75886: but they kept on  clapping for a long long time.
Sentence 75889: this time arlene said and she even kept on wiggling a little bit
Sentence 75892: 6.756255939431794
Sentence 75894: it  all has something to do with general burnside and his horse.
Sentence 75897: this time it was so grand; they could tell exactly what it was.
Sentence 75900: it was general burnside's horse running in a circle.

Sentence 75907: that's the general's horse one of them cried  out.
Sentence 75910: the other remarked in a happy laughter that's  a funny old

Sentence 75914: the first one said he sure does shake.
Sentence 75915: 13.09300332252329

Sentence 75920: they had to be told that one.
Sentence 75921: 22.325776495404497
Sentence 75923: but it was even funnier after  they had been told.
Sentence 75926: their father when he came back from those many  business trips
Sentence 75930: 6.7018463053934445
Sentence 75932: he was the funniest  man.
Sentence 75933: 23.79268092013764
Sentence 75935: he never could keep still even when he didn't move his feet.
Sentence 75938: then they had to get up and be general burnside.
Sentence 75941: all they could think of was to run around in circles kicking their
Sentence 75943: 8.078761807336596
Sentence 75945: then they said general  burnside was going to jump over his
Sentence 75947: 7.411452263715024
Sentence 75949: but that wasn't very funny either.
Sentence 75950: 18.3893642127394
Sentence 75952: you ought to shake arlene advised them.
Sentence 75953: 7.622507342753323

Sentence 75967: 7.5839703308888335
Sentence 75968: 19764.
Sentence 75969: imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling-
